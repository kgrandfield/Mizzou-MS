Most give similar precision/recall but I can only get either good precision (\~1.0) at the cost of low recall (\~0.1) or vice versa. In this case, the goal is to detect the specific user so my decision is to select a high precision model, since user behavior can change in the future and so trying to generalize the model for a higher recall might not be worth the effort. And also, no point in having high recall if most predicted positives are false positives, right?  I tried resampling (over-, under- and SMOTE) but all it does is help me get better recall because the train set is more balanced but the precision is still low.

I am working on a customer analysis for a non-contractual business given the db of transactions and some details of every customer (i.e. amount of tickets opened, amount of tickets resolved, location of each client, etc). More specifically, I am interested in churn prediction and in defining a business rule to define what is an active user.I have been looking at BTYD models based on Pareto/NBD and they look really promising in terms of accuracy of prediction (a plus is I can get not only churn predictions, but also CLV predictions), but they do not allow to incorporate explanatory variables which would be valuable at managerial level.If I understand correctly, as these models are stochastic, they are meant to ""include"" all possible influences when modeling the probabilistic nature of Recency and Frequency, so adding explanatory variables doesn't fit with their philosophy. Still, I have found possible ways to incorporate [time-invariant](http://www.brucehardie.com/notes/019/time_invariant_covariates.pdf) and [time-varying](http://www.brucehardie.com/notes/040/time-varying_covariates_in_BGNBD.pdf) covariates directly from Fader and Hardie, though I am not sure if they are provided out-of-the-box by any library (I am a Python user, so I've been looking at [Lifetimes](https://lifetimes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lifetimes.html)).I was wondering if any of you have worked on a similar problem and could share how have you dealt with this. What I would like to discuss (though not limited to) is:* Is my understanding of why explanatory variables are not included correct?* Why do these models only consider Recency and Frequency? For example, Monetary values are assumed independent. Why does this make sense?* If you guys have worked with something similar, how have you dealt with the explanatory part? i.e. how to give hints on why customers are churning or what drives their CLV/lifetime value high or low?* If using someting apart from BTYD, how do you define the rules of what makes a customer active/alive? Are these rules compatible with these stochastic approaches?Oh, and I found [this thesis](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Thesis_Dimaano.pdf) supervised by Fader on how to incorporate variable selection on these kind of models, though I have not been able to give it a proper look.Thanks!",POS

And I did two very short postdocs (9 months in total) after the PhD using ML. I then landed a data science  job with the federal government. I am a newbie data scientist and really don't feel comfortable calling myself that anyway. **The good**In my nearly two months on the job, I have learned: 1) how pipelines work, specifically the targets package in R. To make for reproducibility and shorter run times on projects that branch (basically using a split-apply-combine approach that doesn't rerun the same code when nothing has changed).2) a little bit on the tidyverse. People love that here and I'm used to writing in base R. At least now I know what people are doing although it's going to be hard switching to writing piped operations myself.3) how to use containers, specifically docker. Useful for when you want code to not break down the road when packages and software get updated. Wish I had used this earlier. I guess if you code in python and manage your environments with anaconda you don't need this (?) 4) how to run code and I/O data from a remote machine (high performance computer). And how to spin up a container with a .slurm script on the remote that opens up Rstudio. This way you can work as you normally would on your local. Really grateful for this.5) a little bit more on git for version control. The part that I had missing was working collaboratively on branches, making pull requests, and managing conflicts-things I didn't  really need to learn since all my previous projects had been solo ventures (gradschool and post grad work). In the months to come, I will also have to learn how to correctly deliver data and project outputs on gitlab, Amazon s3 buckets, science base, etc. I will probably take a python course to be able to read other people's code at the very least. Also, object oriented programming is on the wish list of things to learn. **The bad**Lots of acronyms floating around in discussions that make me lose the thread. The discussions seem really fast-paced and I can't keep up. Some of it is probably because these discussions are not relevant to me, but I still have to listen and follow in case they are. Sometimes words are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which makes it hard to keep up too. Reading other people's code is difficult. But I have to say, my coworkers are rock stars and have very well-documented clean code. They are also generous with explaining what is happening and why with the code that they have written. **The ugly**I'm not sure if I can be of any help to projects since there are so many capable people around.

Then reach out to some recruiters to get back into the swing of interviewing.Most likely only open to FT positions and applying directly. I'm going to compile a list of companies that seem to fit what I'm looking for as well (Salesforce? Shopify?).I currently have 3 YOE in data engineering/science (5 YOE total in tech) and a master's in DS. Mainly worked in setting up AWS infra, Python, Airflow, e-commerce analytics.

In order to make the optimization procedure work, and restrict my optimization domain to the space of ‘reasonable’ solutions, I had to restrict to the conic combination of a certain special set of input vectors.

If I gained financial independence tomorrow, I'd quit my job and never look back, wouldn't even serve out my notice. I'd spend the rest of my time focusing on my hobbies, learning a language (via immersion overseas), spending time with family. These are the things I actually care about and in that list goes my passions. My actual passions, not some bs made up passion I only say is a passion to get a job.Sure, I wouldn't just 'do nothing' for the rest of time. But in order to give back to the community somehow I'd probably volunteer and/or offer my skills to something that actually makes a difference (that may or may not be data related, but I guarantee you it won't be inferring which people are the best targets for a certain product or the like)That's not to say I don't enjoy it. I do. The mathematical theory behind the scenes interests me. But not a passion. Solving some of the issues no matter how mundane can too be satisfying, likewise presenting an end product to a client and them being happy with it. Again, no passion here though. Perhaps I could stretch the visualisation side of things and convince myself it is a passion, but I'd be lying, it is a pseudo passion at best. And even at that, it is the explanation and reactions to the visualisations I enjoy more. In fact, if I did quit tomorrow, I'd probably I'd see myself in a role where I could educate and improve people's, especially children's understanding in mathematics, stats and visualizing data. But if in education, there is no way I'd ever be able to teach the subject with end goals that serve an over-capitalistic society (e.g. with applications in robotics say, I'm all for, less so with applications in how to best sell a useless product that people don't really need)Anyway, floor is open for discussion.

My biggest regrets are coming across as a bit (bigly) of an asshole and also not clarifying that actually I do enjoy what I do! What I was getting at is that passion to me is an incredibly strong word, as mentioned in a comment, it would be like how romantic 'love' is used in a relationship. A word that should be reserved for certain conditions. Certainly not something I'd use in the context of doing work for just about any corporate firm (in most circumstances!)Just because I'm not passionate about my job doesn't mean that I'm not enjoying it. Based on many of the comments here, people are taking this post as though I absolutely hate my role so much that to even suggest that people could possibly enjoy this sort of role is a lie that needs to be addressed! Lol This isn't the case at all. I work in a fairly mundane industry, in fact an incredibly mundane one. I hate it so much I fear people asking me out of worry they'll fall asleep when I explain it. Yet working on the data aspect of things exposes me to different aspects of tech and keeps things interesting to the point that I often enjoy the work I do! I'm also not trying to have a go at people who are genuinely passionate here. Coming across as passionate about how you used x tools to crack y problems and posting your overly enthusiastic YouTube tutorial would be something I'd love to see more on. The 'passion' posts I refer to are ones that simply through in a 'im so passionate about data, how do I get a job' types that add nothing to this sub.

After speaking with a few, they get notifications from LinkedIn for every person who applies. For some positions, that is 25-50 a **day**.

They can do the same faster after all.Yes and no, the true value from data science is automating the process of data analysts. Sure a data analyst can catch fraudsters from a huge dataset with a very high TP rate but we want to capture their process in a model and automate this.

The best I can do is illustrate with an example:Lets say you have a sample of 1000 people and they all make 1 purchase per year at your store. Each individual's time of purchase is uniformly distributed throughout the year, and the quantity that they purchase during that single event varies with some distribution.If I were to model the sum of all purchases throughout the year, you could easily do this with some basic timeseries modelling and would get a reasonable result (nothing fancy here).Now, if you were asked to make an individual forecast for each purchaser at your store throughout the year, this would pose a bigger problem due to the fact that the data becomes very jumpy (11 months of no purchase then a single month of a purchase with varying quantity). Understandably if you were to try to forecast this with classic timeseries modelling like Holt Winters or ARIMA, the model would be pretty useless as it would likely consistently over-predict on the 11 months without purchase and way under-predict the single random month where they make a big purchase.Now let's say you were asked to take all those individual forecasts and aggregate them to yield your ""total forecast"" for 1000 people. Due to the fact that all those single-purchase forecasts were pretty useless, this aggregate would also likely be pretty useless.My first question is: is my intuition correct on this?

Simply get alpha for each row beforehand, and predict Y\*alpha directly. So basically my target is replaced by this Y\*alpha term. This will be Y in some cases and 0 in others.2.

I have a M.Sc in Computer Science (AI specialization) and 3 YoE in the IT sector with slightly more than 1 YoE as a DS considering my thesis(7+ months in the current company).## TL;DR  Despite successfully completing a trouble DS project, my company assigned me to a  front end development project that I don't like and more importantly I don't have the needed skills (as all the other team members). How can I make the most of the next months for improving my DS skills and land a better job?## Extended versionUntil summer holidays things at work were going extremely well. I worked in a Computer Vision project and together with another colleague we were able to completely turnaround things: the final client went from being ready to pull the plug due to lack of results to put some extra efforts to share the annotation burden and prepare all the ""commercial infrastructure"" needed for selling the final product to a lot of interested customers. This is something that my bosses are extremely happy with and they have publicly acknowledged our works more than once.The next project I was assigned wasn't a data science one as I was expecting (based also on the previously mentioned project success) but an unrelated front end development one, that would be done by 5 data scientists including myself, without any skill or interest in Javascript and its ecosystem (and this was known to our boss, as he personally interviewed all of us and knows our technical skills) . We expressed our disappointment, together with the huge delay and poor quality the product will likely face due to our inexperience: despite being told that it was just a preliminary activity needed for having a first estimate and that the actual job will be done by proper software developers, we ended up being the ones having to do it. My boss expect a first release in around a month, but considering that we're still reading books, writing ""hello world"" equivalents and watching YT tutorials just to understand the existing undocumented code base it is clear we will fail it.The best decision in this case (but of course let me know your thoughts about it) is probably to go elsewhere, considering that our opinions and skills are never taken into consideration and the only goal is to finish high priority projects at all costs.However, I would like to wait 3/4 months before looking elsewhere due to the incoming ""productivity bonus"" (+1 monthly salary)  as well as the fact that I never stayed more than one year in a company so I do not want to sabotage myself from a CV analysis perspective: considering my 30 days notice period I was thinking to start polishing my CV and actively applying from November.Despite not being an ideal scenario, I never had to do any extra hours, I have a good relationship with all my colleagues (we voluntarily hang out together, organizing what to do without any boss's intervention) and luckily both my friends and family are there for spending some quality time every week, therefore I think I can resist a bit more without having serious consequences in my personal life.What should you suggest to do in order to make the most of the next months for improving my Data Science skills and being ready to transition to a better role elsewhere? I usually spend 30/45 minutes of my spare time reading about topics in the field I care about (using papers and posts like Towards Data Science ones), even though I'll probably need to better structure these self-learning activities.

In my opinion many of these places had red flags from to get go based on the description of the company they gave. My main advice is to be as critical to the company as they are to you:Screen their job posting with as much rigour as they screen your CV trying to get a sense of what you'll *really* be doing irrespective of your 'data scientist' job title. Typical red flags for me would be (not exhaustive):* No mention of cloud related tooling.* SQL and data warehousing featuring more promintently than anything else. Reason being that if I wanted to do a DA job, which I really enjoyed from past experiences, I would just apply for that.* No mention of any kind of version control.* ""Use whatever tools and languages you want on the job"". This one is very particular but to me that would indicate no standardisation, probably a lot of csv files, excel users, ad-hoc analysis on notebooks and very little being put into production / automated. This might be a pet peeve but I believe in many cases long term value from data can't *just* be done through ad-hoc analyses and 99 % of companies aren't mature enough to let everyone use their own tools without it becoming an unmaintanable mess.* No mention of anything casual. This one is personal, colleagues are colleagues and not necessarily friends but a workplace with a few social amenities would make being 8-9 hours in the office more bearable.Not all of the information you value can be gotten from the job posting so the next step would be to think about what you value ahead of the interview and ask them in a polite manner. Job interviews should be as much of you deciding if they are a fit for you as vice versa.This may help you to uncover small details that can help you decide picking one offer over the other. Even if you only have 1 offer knowing what you're getting into in advance can help you make peace with / prepare for it.",POS

The inaurance company processes insurance claims. Let's say there are 100 people working at the insurance company: everyday, new claims arrive and existing claims are settled - but there is always a backlog. In terms of strategies, the insurance company is considering hiring new employees: they are thinking of 5 new employees (strategy 1: costs $ 200,000), 10 new employees (strategy 2 : costs $ 500,000) or 15 new employees (strategy 3: costs $ 700,000).The logic being, perhaps more employees could result in: fewer backlog through out the year, faster processing time of claims or smaller payouts to the claim filers (e.g. lets assume that each claim has to be processed in under 30 days, if a claim is approaching 30 days - the insurance company tries to negotiate and pay 50% of the amount owed instead of the whole amount).In terms of the ""transitions"", different options can be considered:A) The amount of backlog in the system (e.g. state A = less than 100 claims, state B = 101 to 200 claims, state C = more than 201 claims). Using existing data,  transition matrix can be made to construct this transition matrix (3 × 3).B) The average number of days spent on a claim (e.g. state A = less than 10 days , state B = 11 days to 25 days, state C = more than 25 claims). Using existing data,  transition matrix can be made to construct this transition matrix (3 × 3)C) The average percentage of the full amount saved on a case (e.g. state A = insurance company pays on average pays less than 50% of cases, state B = pays between 51% and 75% , state C = pays more than 75%). Using existing data,  transition matrix can be made to construct this transition matrix (3 × 3).A historical dataset is available that contains information on every claim settled: how long it took, the dates it was with the company, the amount negotiated. Data is also available on how many people were working at different times throughout the past few years. This is enough information to easily determine daily, weekly, monthly averages of A), B) and C). E.g. if you choose to make a markov chain with C), you have the choice of making the transition matrix by day, week or month (of course, the state thresholds then change).My question is: I understand how to run a simulation that shows on any given day, which state the transition matrix (i.e. markov chain) will be in. Question 1: But how can you calculate the cost and benefit (utility) of being in state A, state B and State C? I thought of adding integer scores to each state (e.g. state A = 3, state B = +2, state C = +1), . Assuming that its always more advantageous to be in state A,  you run the simulation for 100 days and add the score on each day. A score 201 could mean that the system was on the whole ""healthier"" than the system with a score of 167. Is there another way of doing this? Question 2: I know the cost of each strategy. But how do you attribute a benefit to each strategy? The best I can think about is trying to look at the historical data available and try to look at the system statistics when more people were hired vs less people, and how this affected backlog, average amount negotiated, etc. And then recreate the markov chain/transition matrix for these periods (e.g. select all rows of data for a period when 100 people were hired and create markov chain vs when 150 people were working and create markov chain). These will have different transitions probabilities between states.Can someone please provide some advice on this? In general, am I understand the use of cost-benefit simulation correctly? Could this simulation serve as a legitimate method to decide which strategy to select?Thanks!",POS

To clarify, I define an analyst someone who uses data to produce insights (call it Business Intelligence , Data mining, etc.).In my definition (everyone has a different one), a data scientist does Machine Learning on a production level scale while a data analyst does reporting, data mining, maybe  prototypes or smaller scale ML projects. Back to my point, I feel like data analysts get pressured + forced to level up and progress to be data scientists. 1) They get pressured by their data scientist peers because think they are higher on the social rank than analysts. 2) Forced meaning you can only earn so much as a data analyst before either becoming a data scientist or going into management. With that being said, data analysts are very under appreciated as not many people know as well as them. Show me a data analyst who has been in that role for several years, and I’ll show you someone who knows the business inside and out. Unfortunately, due to the above mentioned reasons, you rarely see experienced data analysts. This is a major reason why companies struggle to find value in AI/ML projects (85% of AI projects fail). Everyone wants to go and do ‘cool’ Machine Learning and Advanced AI, but without the dirty work done by the analyst, the project will struggle to bring value.  Data analysts should get compensated just as much as data scientists because they bring just as much if not more value. Lastly, I’m not saying data scientists are over rated or anything, but as a data scientist you have to build models (building great models is a lot of work). You do not have the time to know the ins and outs of the business. Businesses today are very complex and there is almost always a gray area and exceptions.

We're thinking about a question with my teammates and I think your opinions and advice can be very relevant. It's in the title: we are thinking of putting our product in open source. For context, I'll describe our solution in 3 points (without naming it or putting a link to avoid being accused of self-promotion): 1/ Our product aggregates various AI APIs (computer vision, NLP, speech-to-text, etc.) into a single API. 2/ It includes a feature that dynamically directs the data processing request to the ""optimal"" provider. 3/ It offers a reseller contract that allows access to a multitude of services with a single account. We are thinking of putting the first one in open source to allow developers to have the aggregator (having in this case to create several accounts with different providers and without taking advantage of the automatic recommendation). This guarantees a ""continuity of service"" if by misfortune our company stops. And above all, it would build a community around our product. But at the same time, we try to measure the potential risk (in relation to potential competitors in particular). Maybe there are some issues we haven't thought of?What do you think about it? What would be your advice? Thanks in advance to those who will take the time to answer me. Thanks, Taha",POS

I'm hoping to lean more heavily on the coding part rather than thinking out lots of algorithms.So I guess I have 2 questions:1) is it common to be just an NLP implementer, like using tensor flow to develop quick models and maybe deploy them on a docker or do 90% of NLP jobs want mathematicians?2) what skills would you suggest someone brushes up on to continue in this direction (sklearn, tensor flow, probability, Markov models, etc.)I know this is kind of a vague question but I appreciate the advice!",POS

Consider we have a dataset containing: User UID | Item Purchased | $ Amount Spent .The task would be to find similar items given a type of item that appears in the dataset (e.g. if I have ""hairdryer"" as an input, I want to return the most relevant related items in order of relevancy).The way I had thought to do this was filter and create multiple filtered dataframes containing only one purchase type, and find the mean amount spent per user. Then, I could consider pairs of products and find the cross-section of users who purchased both products, using an inner join. The amount spent could act as a sort of 'score' (e.g. if user x spent loads on both products then it's a pretty good bet other people might too). The problem comes when we have an imbalanced dataset - if we have one product dominating the purchases, it's always the first to be recommended. In my head we need to balance up the dataset before using this approach, but I'm struggling to think of how you'd use an oversampling technique, like SMOTE, when you have real user IDs to consider. All I can think of so far is to undersample the majority class, or maybe use some sort of batched training approach where only a certain equal batch size is used at each epoch, or something.Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

This company is relatively new but is backed by a major, multinational consultancy company (not Big 4 but close). In essence, my company exists to take over the data science parts of the parent company's consultancy jobs. I cannot emphasize this enough: my company is all about data science and machine learning. ML is even part of its name (not exactly but I'm keeping things vague to ensure anonymity).My interview process was 95% focused on my ML skills. I was really happy about that as I had left my last job because despite having the title of Data Scientist I had ended up doing basic data analysis stuff on Excel. So I was hoping that finally, I'll get to do some ML for a living. So I'm assigned on my first project (which is about a **huge** client) and... It ends up being analyzing data over an excel file (i.e., simple descriptive analytics, basic visualizations, etc.). This project is relatively short and the excel part may end up being a fluke (i.e., the following projects may be very ML-oriented) or... not. So I'm starting to wonder: How many ""data scientists"" actually spend most of their time on ML/DL/NLP (including preparing data etc. of course)? Are most data scientists in truth data analysts?**EDIT:** To the people giving me advice, I appreciate it but I'm not looking for it.

But to-date I can't seem to understand what tools I need to find out what I am looking for. I am going to try to explain what roughly what it is; and if this isn't the right sub, could someone please point me in the right direction?So the idea revolves around a couple types of lotteries. But I ll quickly dive into one:[https://dclottery.com/games/dc-4](https://dclottery.com/games/dc-4)The above model of the lottery example has 1 prize per draw and is paid out at 1:5000 ratio. Presumably idea is that if you sell enough tickets that covers at least half the permutations you should be profitable statistically provided all bets sizes and total sale amount remain constant through extended periods of time. My guess would be as such, with a bankroll of $25000, I prolly would have the risk appetite to take on $0.1 per perm should I have at least 5001 permutations, $2 per perm if i cover 8000 permutations, and $5 per bet should I cover all 10000 permutations. <- This is regardless, if every permutation has that amount of bets in question. It should scale inversely right? The bets taken v number of permutations covered.Of course, the lottery in question, has quite a different pay scale types of prizes offered.***""Standard Ticket""*** **(Offers 20 Prizes)**Top 1/2/3 - Max RatesNext 7 Prizes - Lower RateLast 10 Prizes - Even Lower Rate***""I'm feeling Lucky"" (Offers only Payout on Top 3)***1/2/3 - Higher rates than ""Standard Ticket"" Max ratesHouse edge of ""I'm feeling lucky"" has a much lower house edge.  But it also means it has lesser variance.TD;LR:Lottery sales currently only pay x% commissions. If I am generating enough sales, at what stage can I be taking on the bets on my own rather than placing it directly with the lottery owner. Is someone able to use the data to determine with a fixed bankroll and suggested risk tolerance how big of a bet I should/can be taking up to ensure profitability.&#x200B;I am trying to fundraise to finance this project. I currently cover a spread of 7/8000 permutations either/or/both *Standard* and *I'm Feeling Lucky* with the minimum bet sizing starting at about 0.10c all the way to $200.  I have to be able to determine if I can come up with a indicated rate of return by a potential investor.I have the data of the of the spread of numbers and ticket sizes per permutation.The platform does allows me tweak a setting whereby you can choose an amount of the bet size before placing the rest into the system.Would really appreciate the help if someone can point me to the direction of someone who can help me figure this out.&#x200B;Thanks.EDIT: Question is basically, what kind of information am i looking for using my data to be able to justify at what level of bet size should i take on to ensure profitability.

I'm also bad in terms of best practices and staying on top of new developments. So that should be kept in mind.Caveats out of the way... am I the only one who finds Python massively more difficult to use? I'm the only member of the DS team at my company at the moment and we just had someone leave who was primarily in Python. Some of his code broke and now I'm having to troubleshoot it. I can't make heads or tails. With my R code things are basically sequential and you can tell what's happening by searching object names and following changes to those objects. Whenever I look at my colleagues' python code it rarely resembles that. And it's cumbersome to run pieces of code and see where it's breaking. In R I can easily run this piece, then the next piece, then look inside constituent functions.I've also never seen anything in my colleagues' code that resembles tidyverse. I'm ridiculously more efficient in data munging than I was in base R. Most of my data comes from the wild and cleaning data seems like a nightmare in Python. It could just be a skillset thing, but my when my Python colleagues would be responsible for cleaning data I would regularly find some troubling errors. I can't help but think it may have to do with the tool they're using.My other gripe is environments. My old boss had some great projects, but the shit rarely runs for me. I spend a huge amount of time trying to set up the appropriate environments.A more constructive question is how can I get my hands around this? Any time I sit down to learn Python I spend a lot of time on minor concepts that I would likely pick up anyway. After a few weeks I'm so bored that when other things come up I just drop it. The way I learned R involved adapting other people's code and understanding how it works. I'd pick apart something advanced and figure out simpler concepts as a part of that process.

If this is not the right place please let me know. I work within the functional services division of a clinical research company. Our remit is to provide staff to pharma and biotech companies. We hire the resources and charge a monthly fee to the client. Without going into too much detail our monthly fees are calculated afresh for each client request and are largely driven by the expected salary for the resource we intend to hire. We agree the rate with the client before we have any candidates lined up so the salary estimate that we use to build the rate is a prediction based on market knowledge and previous hiring experience.Right now, each time we have a new client request, we go through a manual review process with HR to determine a salary value to use for the rate calculation. I'd like to attempt to build out some sort of predictive model that could supply a good suggested value to use - the idea being that if it works well, we could reduce the number of items that have to go through manual review. My language of choice is R so I'd prefer an R-flavoured solution if possible.It will be my first time building such a model and I have some questions:* Is this a good use case for a predictive model?* Would this be considered a linear regression model?* Can I do this in R?* The features I have to predict salary are: resource title, country and hire date. That is to say, my features are categorical. Can I work with these features?* We hire resources globally and rates and salaries are first calculated in local currency, then converted to whatever currency the client wishes to contract in. Therefore, my salary values can be in a range of currencies. Would I need to consider a separate model for each currency? Or would I need to normalise my values to some currency (e.g. USD) first?* What would be the best resources for me to consult on how to do this? Ideally in R.

I did the analytics for my PhD using Stata and am fairly comfortable in it. Problem is that in the new job, which is quasi-academic, the quality of graphs and visualisation is kind of important. Graphs made on Stata doesn't cut it. The organisation suggestion was to use Tableau and I am fairly decent at that, problem is that I don't like pointing and clicking, I would rather write code and mass-produce the visualisations required for reporting. Moreover, I also thought that knowing free software will keep me competitive in the market.  I started on Python and I have been struggling since. Initially, I thought that it was the learning curve, but when I started replicating my workflow in Stata on Python, I find myself increasingly stuck in multiple areas with no way out. A small example of this is below: foreach var of varlist p2_1 p2_2_1-p3_7_10 p4_1-p5_10 p5_12-p5_20 {asdoc tab `var'asdoc tab id_1_1 `var', row nofreqasdoc tab id_1_2 `var', row nofreq} Four lines of code on Stata, takes all the variables, runs a loop, prints out descriptive stats with disaggregations and exports it all out on a word file which my older colleagues can also scroll through. I just cannot seem to be able to replicate this and cannot find help for it either.   My initial decision to work on python was because I read that it has the widest support base on the internet.

I generally refer to reddit, look at youtube tutorials, online articles and stack overflow to learn how to replicate my workflow. Am I just approaching it the wrong way or should I be looking at other resources? I mean I never get any responses on Stack overflow and in general, my needs seem to be a very weird niche (then again I always thought it doesn't matter what my problem is, someone already has posted about it online!).   3.

The specific task involves using lots of unsupervised learning models - KNN, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, Agglomerative, etc. The only way I see out is to break (say for example) a 4 GB input file into batches of 1 GB files and after training on the first batch of data do:1. load saved model2. load current batch of data3. train model4. save trained modelFor this resource constrained approach, I see lots of caveats:1. Since the entire data distribution is not known, getting the data as batches, say the proper scaling cannot be used - MinMax, Standard, Robust, etc.2. The model (say KMeans) being trained might have variances similar to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) trying to converge.

Instead, we will ""invent the future"" and evaluate different versions of our predictive models using different datasets...

So 2.5 years ago, I decided to transition into data science. My background is in psychology, which I stopped liking and chose something that I think I'd enjoy. I was always keen on statistics and had some basic knowledge of R. It was a very risky move for me as I already had an income and a family to support. Long story short, 2.5 years later I am graduating with an MSc in DS (i know that this sub's take on DS masters is very bad). Those past 2 years have really been a struggle for me trying to juggle around a master,  a part-time job, parenthood ( especially the last bit is quite draining when you are in this kind of situation). During those last years, I have also been reading some horror stories about how saturated the field is, how impossible it is to get a junior DS job, which might be true but... I haven't graduated yet and had already three offers( one data analyst in deloite, one contract data scientist in the government, and a permanent junior data scientist in a fintech app( i accepted the latter).  I am really over the moon to have landed a DS job with all this irrelevant background, having not even finished my MSc, but I did it and it feels very nice. Now, the impostor syndrome has kicked in and I feel like I won't be up to the task and I'll be sacked (i hope not 😁).  Some of my questions are: What are some good practices for a graduate DS, and what do sensible employers expect from a graduate (i am also stressed due to their data science team being small. We will be only three people. An ML engineer, a senior DS and me). Also, has anyone from social sciences or something that irrelevant managed to land a DS job, and what their experience has been like? Thank you in advance",POS

I’m two years into my bachelors degree and I find myself dreading the thought of coding during my future job. I’m 20, female, and will be starting my junior year of college. I’ve taken two semesters worth of intro to computer science classes where I “learned” C++. I find it difficult for myself to write code under pressure, and I find it extremely frustrating when my code just doesn’t work, and I’m already pretty hard on myself. When I can’t work through tough problems on my own I get all depressed and then completely discouraged. I’ve had moments where I’ve found it impossible for me to overcome blocks, where I’ve had panic attacks and mental breakdowns over meeting deadlines. (I also think it’s important to mention, that these mostly happened with my online class). These next two years are going to be very coding-intense, learning things like R, Python, SAS, SQL, etc. and I’m nervous about how I’m going to manage when I don’t even feel like I have a base understanding of programming. I barely got by with A’s in both semesters, but I still wouldn’t be able to recall or apply most of that information. I’m lazy, unmotivated, and I’m at an all time low in my life right now. Dropping out or changing majors isn’t an option. Any advice? I guess I just want some encouragement through all of this instead of listening to myself be so negative.EDIT:To the people asking why I don’t just switch majors, it’s because I haven’t found a single thing that catches my interest. I was originally a CS major and switched after hating my first two CS classes, and switched to stats & data science knowing that the coding would be lighter. I’ve weighed out every possible option for myself — actuarial science, economics, teaching, even nursing, and all have led me back here. I’m unable to go back to community college to take classes and “find my passion” since I’ll be moving to uni in a couple of weeks. I can’t live at home for another couple years for my mental sake. On top of all that, I’m under financial pressure to finish my degree (and get a job) as soon as possible. Essentially, the risk would be greater than the reward, and I’m not willing to take the risk. Sure, I may not like coding, but I’m willing to put in the work to meet the end result, and hopefully find some reason to enjoy coding in the end.

This is mainly because you will definitely have a lot more technical knowledge and that may even put you ahead of a CS or statistician for many roles (DS positions in chemistry, financial engineering, actuarial science, bio-med, bio-informatics, ...).Personally I did a BSc and MSc in business engineering which is a prime option too because it's heavy in math in stat (nearly all courses are quantitative). You also get courses in financial engineering, supply chain engineering, digital marketing which are key domains because banks and logistics are where a lot of DS demand is. You also get knowledge in fields that are overlooked by a lot of data scientists like stohastic calculus and operations research. If you study this you're worse at IT related competences than someone that did CS (but better than a statistician) and worse at statistics than a MSc in stat (but better than someone that did CS). In my opinion domain/business knowledge and knowing a myriad of other techniques level up the playing field.The main point I want to make is if you want to be a data scientist, don't be afraid to evaluate options that aren't strictly CS or statistics because one of these may be an even better fit for your interests and career path.",POS

I am currently working on evaluating so called Static Analysis Security Tools for a project and want to compare their performance. This turns out to not be as trivial as I first thought. These tools scan program code and return, without running the code, places which could be relevant for security concerns. For this purpose I am using the [Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD)](https://samate.nist.gov/SRD/testsuite.php) which contains code pieces and the corresponding CWE number (which stands for Common Weakness Enumeration and is a way of categorizing different types of vulnerabilities) for each error. They can be looked up [here](https://cwe.mitre.org/). In the dataset I use, every file contains either exactly one error, or no error at all and the correct CWE number is written into the file name. So if tool X scans the file called CWE\_89\_blabla.php, it should ideally return only the CWE-89 error. There are also files which are deliberate error free examples in order to be able to test for true negative results.The problem I'm facing right now is, that each of the tools do often times return multiple results for every file, effectively ruining the statistic, even if they do return the correct error category within these results.Additionally there is a decent chance that the multiple other returned values for a single file are not false positives at all. For instance, having a password or username in the program code is considered an error which is of course a valid concern but this is not reflected in the dataset since each files is supposed to only contain one error. Thus I cannot know whether the other returned values are valid if I do not look manually at all about 65000 results (per tool), which is just not possible.I then mark every result as the corresponding result class (true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative) and calculated the metrics accuracy, precision, recall and the f-measure. The resulting values are worse than I thought, with much higher false positive rates than is reasonably practical. I suspect the many multiple outputs per file to be the problem here. Is there maybe a better metric to use for data like this?Also, what if I want to create a confusion matrix? There I compare only one value from the test dataset with one prediction of the tool, but since the tool returns multiple results per point in the dataset, the number of results returned by the tool and the size of the original dataset are different. I could however repeat each value in the dataset as many times as there are results for the value.Furthermore, I noticed that the dataset is also imbalanced. It has about 12000 instances for true positive results and about 29000 instances for true negative results. I know this does have an influence in some cases, so is this also relevant in this case? Does it influence the validity of the results if every tool gets the same dataset to scan?I thought about maybe consolidating multiple results per file into one, meaning, for instance, if there is a correct result within the set of returned results, then this would be registered as a true positive whereas, if there were only false results it would be registered as a false positive. Would maybe weighting the values be a good approach?Also keep in mind that every tool I want to look at does return different amounts of results for each file.I hope this was at least somewhat coherent and if you have some pointers for me, it would be very much welcome. Even just some keywords for me to search for would be appreciated. Also if there is a better approach for this kind of problem, please let me know!",POS

How to not repeat the same mistake when looking for jobs in the futureHello friends,I have been working as a data analyst due to get promoted to a senior data analyst position soon. I am originally a healthcare professional but changed my career into clinical research with a focus on biostatistics, particularly interested in healthcare data science both out of my own interest and also because I couldn't find a job in my original field, which is doing terrible as far as the job market goes. I was initially considering pursuing a PhD to do research, as I've worked, turns out I enjoy programming and data science and can envision doing a job where I'm spending most of my day writing code rather than coming up with research questions (though would be interested in writing papers where the opportunity may arise just not from a PhD perspective).I started off with extremely minimal programming experience and a ton of difficulties finding jobs in the past, so I have had terrible imposter syndrome and always sold myself short. When I had just graduated from my masters, I had a professor interview me for a FT position and then trick me into doing a part time task for her and almost didn't pay me for it. After that waste of time, I got hired to work as a statistician for physicians who had a very ""don't ask anything, just do your job"" policy-70% of my job was data entry and the small 30% where I actually did statistical analysis after being told ""I'm the person for whom the entire responsibility of these publications rests upon"", I almost didn't get my name on the papers I did the entire methods for. When I asked if they could hire a junior position to help me with data entry, I got threatened with termination. I was making 54K (USD) in that job, then transitioned into my current job in government where I'm making 26K more and expected to make an additional 17K more once my promotion is set.The good thing about my current job is that I feel much more confident in my data science skills than when I started. I also started dabbling in other programming languages and feel more sure of my skills than when I was at my previous workplaces. The bad thing here is that because it's government, bureaucracy makes things horribly inefficient and because a lot of analysts are more research oriented than programming oriented, a lot of the processes done for years has been extremely manual and tedious work taking 40+ hours a month that I helped to almost completely automate with little appreciation because nobody realizes how bad this stuff is behind the scenes.At this point, I feel like I'm not going to be learning anything much if I stick around here and want to transition to a role where I'm never touching SAS and using R and Python with the opportunity to dabble in dev skills too . I'd also like to work somewhere where 1. there's room for growth, 2. I feel like I'm being compensated well for my analytical skills-I've thus far been making less than 6 figures.I have an interview coming up for a job in my original healthcare field-I have been wanting to do some clinical work too as I miss doing that work, but the job I'm being considered for is one I didn't apply to and one that seems administrative in nature rather than clinical and one where they seem extremely excited to consider me mainly for my data science skills even though data science is not a requirement for the job, just something they've kept mentioning is so unique for somebody with my background and extremely useful for them. I don't know the salary yet, but they mentioned a ballpark of $93,000 starting. I'm hoping to negotiate further, but I doubt they'd pay me more than $110,000.I spent so many years making WAY less than people who graduated with me and got jobs in my original field because I couldn't find a job and hoped that investing time in pursuing DS will make up for it in the future. I know every job will have its drawbacks and every employer more or less will take advantage of its employers, but I don't want to repeat the same mistakes I've made in the past now that I have 4+ years of experience. I'm just looking for some insight on how to not repeat the same mistakes-insights and honest feedback would be appreciated.Thanks all",POS

This is not a personal attack against the OP. I've seen this circulated in my LinkedIn as well - usually by marketing or sales people.I attended a presentation from a Director of marketing at my previous company where they were claiming that their webinars drove conversion because attendees of their webinar had significantly higher conversion rates higher than those who did not. I had to slowly, but painfully explain that correlation does not imply causation. The webinar didn't drive conversions, it's just that the customers who were interested in what we were selling were more likely to attend the webinar.The director could have avoided this situation by sharing their data / presentation with any of the 20 data scientists f in the team for feedback before presenting to senior leadership.You can construct a beautiful house from your unstructured data all you want , that doesn't make it a reflection of reality. So please partner with your data scientists before making presentations with data.",POS

Looking for some old-fashioned objective advice from internet strangers who have no personal stake in my decision.I have a job offer to be an analyst at a law firm with an international presence. I wasn't actively looking, but I entertained the idea, and here I am with an actual decision to make.I'm currently working remotely at an ad agency as a senior analyst, where my great boss left two months ago. I have lots of gripes with my company, but the benefits have been good, and I don't hate my work...at least most days. But damn am I sick of the bullshit, and endless turnover.Pros of taking the job:- More money (+12%), $70k- International connections - Local office vs. fully remote, still with flexibility- Industry change- Slightly bigger team and a manager- Focus; not having 10+ clients/projects- Letting my sinking ship of a company (at least, that's how it feels at times) get fuckedCons:- Job almost feels like a step backwards; lots of manual reporting and data cleaning, not using any viz tools but they're ""considering them""- Work / content might be kind of a bore - Despite a local office, most team members  are abroad; probably won't meet too many people in person. Cool, but not likely a great ""culture"" shift- Not sure about the growth path, but the team has goals- Corporate environment and lawyers- Leaving great coworkers and unlimited PTO at my current company- Leaving would essentially render our team defunct, as my other team member would leave as well. All of our efforts would likely disappear, which is kind of dishearteningI have lots of other thoughts that are running through my brain, but I'll leave it there.What are your thoughts? Should I take the job? Appreciate your analysis.--- UPDATE in case anyone stumbles upon this.Despite all of the BS going on at my current position, I decided to stay. The cons of stalling my skills outweighed the benefits. I'll probably keep searching, though. Here's hoping I made the right choice. Thanks to all for the advice.",POS

Or if your goal is to get a better network, the benchmark might be to attend a certain number of conferences or set up 1:1s with people throughout the company).

I am wondering what the best resources are for learning this stuff. Time series analysis is a huge topic in itself you could do a couple of years on it *easily*. Anyone from EE knows that signals and systems is an amazing quite beautiful subject in its own right, independently of any ML component. I've studied nonlinear differential equations quite a bit, and there you have literally a lifetime you could work on (hell you can literally do an entire PhD on a single set of equations). But now I'm in DS, and want to learn more practical ML with time series, and am not really sure where to start.  What the lay of the land is in terms of how to learn the big picture, and then dive in with code, in an accurate way? Below are a few things I've found online that look pretty decent, but I wonder if people have opinions about the higher quality things (e.g., is `sktime` considered a high-quality library)?- https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/time-series-analysis-python/- https://www.datacamp.com/courses/time-series-analysis-in-python- https://towardsdatascience.com/sktime-a-unified-python-library-for-time-series-machine-learning-3c103c139a55Here is a popular ""caveat"" type article that seems fun:- https://towardsdatascience.com/how-not-to-use-machine-learning-for-time-series-forecasting-avoiding-the-pitfalls-19f9d7adf424Anyway, it would be great to see some suggestions about any materials -- articles, books, videos, courses, code bases, anything -- especially the main libraries that ""Duh anyone that does this knows to use this.""
