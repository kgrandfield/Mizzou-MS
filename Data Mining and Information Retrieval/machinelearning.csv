We showed how their outputs can be understood as mean-field spin expectation values of simple Ising-like vector-spin systems. Physically, the process of training a transformer module can be interpreted as a classical many-body system modulating its behavior by learning how to respond to being probed by incoming data.In this follow-up project, we flesh out the idea of looking at transformer modules as spin systems. Having identified vector-spin systems as plausible physical models underlying transformers, we turn to the 1960s statistical-mechanics literature to look for inspiration on how to deal with their partition functions. We rediscover that the partition function of a particular class of vector-spin models can be approximated in the limit of large local spin dimension using steepest descent, leading to approximate yet tractable expressions for the free energy and other derived quantities.Combining these canonical results from statistical mechanics with modern differentiable programming, we implement a differentiable vector-spin model. Internally, the model uses an implicit layer to solve for the stationary point of the partition function in a differentiable way. We then construct a transformer-like attention module which encapsulates the spin model by routing inputs to applied magnetic fields and spin expectation values to outputs. The latter are obtained by following the familiar recipe of statistical mechanics: differentiating the spin model’s (approximate) log partition function with respect to its conjugate input variables.**Blog post:** https://mcbal.github.io/post/transformers-from-spin-models-approximate-free-energy-minimization/**Code:** https://github.com/mcbal/afem**TL;DR:** We interpret transformer modules as vector-spin systems familiar from statistical mechanics. We implement a differentiable vector-spin model whose couplings act as learnable parameters and probe it with data to find a transformer-like attention response.

We argue that there is a gap between academic research in NLP and its application to problems outside academia, and that this gap is rooted in poor mutual understanding between academic researchers and their non-academic peers who seek to apply research results to their operations. To foster transfer of research results from academia to non-academic settings, and the corresponding influx of requirements back to academia, we propose a method for improving the communication between researchers and external stakeholders regarding the accessibility, validity, and utility of data based on Data Readiness Levels. While still in its infancy, the method has been iterated on and applied in multiple innovation and research projects carried out with stakeholders in both the private and public sectors.

For common scenes like a  standard kitchen or street scenes these scales might be learnable, but others might be harder.So my questions are:  How is the output of these techniques interpreted at the moment? Is it more like a relative guideline to compare what object is closer or can it be used to make rough estimates in e.g. meters? And how do these ""zero-shot"" techniques behave in environments where a sense of scale might be harder to get e.g. in the scene includes miniatures of some kind?

This is joint work with Stefano Soatto at the UCLA Vision Lab.In a nutshell: we propose a method for point cloud densification (from camera, IMU, range sensor) that can generalize well across different sensor platforms. The figure in this link  illustrates our improvement over existing works: https://github.com/alexklwong/calibrated-backprojection-network/blob/master/figures/overview_teaser.gifThe slightly longer version: previous methods, when trained on one sensor platform, have problem generalizing to different ones when deployed to the wild. This is because they are overfitted to the sensors used to collect the training set. Our method takes image, sparse point cloud and camera calibration as input, which allows us to use a different calibration at test time. This significantly improves generalization to novel scenes captured by sensors different than those used during training. Amongst our innovations is a ""calibrated backprojection layer"" that imposes strong inductive bias on the network (as opposed trying to learn everything from the data). This design allows our method to achieve the state of the art on both indoor and outdoor scenarios while using a smaller model size and boasting a faster inference time.For those interested, here are the links topaper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10531.pdfcode (pytorch): https://github.com/alexklwong/calibrated-backprojection-network",POS

The explanation suggested here, if I'm understanding it correctly, is that the effective dimensionality of the parameter space is reduced since neural nets, like support vector machines, may be deriving optimal hyperplane decision boundaries, rather than being able to use all their parameters to define more gerrymandered overfitting boundaries.[https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-link-to-an-old-model-could-crack-the-mystery-of-deep-learning-20211011/](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-link-to-an-old-model-could-crack-the-mystery-of-deep-learning-20211011/)What frustrates me every time this comes up is that I really don't understand why multi-layer neural nets would NOT be expected to generalize if fed the right type of training data. I guess either there's something wrong with my mental model of what neural nets are doing,  or perhaps my mental model is right in that it predicts the observed behavior of generalization, and similar to this new explanation it's based on what hyperplane decision boundaries are being learnt.Here's my mental model of what's going on. Please excuse if this all seems obvious, because it does seem obvious!1. Each layer (or node in more general case) of a neural net can be considered as mapping an input space to an output space (who's dimensions are the number of inputs and outputs respectively).2. The way each layer performs this input space to output space mapping is by learning hyperplane decision boundaries that carve up the input space into chunks corresponding to the output space.Not that it's important to this conceptual model, but presumably it's the activation functions that are really defining the position of these decision boundaries, with the layer's weights having learnt to warp/scale the input space coordinates such that the following fixed activation functions can then do their job.3) The neural net as a whole, just like an individual layer, can be regarded as mapping an input space (samples) to an output space (labels), and does so via a (multi-layer) hierarchy of decision boundaries which carve up the evolving (layer output) feature spaces such that at the output layer each label is defined by a set of decision boundaries which isolate samples having a given label.4) In the overfitting case (including the extreme case where the training set had random labels uncorrelated to the samples) each label is defined by decision boundaries isolating a chunk of input/feature space containing a single sample, or small set of samples (not all of those with the same label).5) In the generalization case, the training set needs to have consisted of consistently labelled samples such that the labels correspond to features learnable by the neural net (e.g. hierarchical visual patterns). In this case, if it has learned to generalize, what will have happened is that the decision boundaries will have isolated chunks of input/feature space each containing many samples with the same label. Generalization occurs since unseen samples with the same features will therefore fall into this same chunk of output space - i.e. receive the same label.6) What makes the difference between overfitting and generalization is mostly the training data - whether the training samples have features in common (that can be learnt by the net in question) that correspond to the given labels, and whether there is sufficient variety of samples (after augmentation) to provide coverage of the features space such that there is no ambiguity in which sets of features correspond to each label.The key to the ""mystery of generalization"" seems to be that if the above training data conditions are met, then the error feedback encountered during training will be consistent across samples with the same label and will be moving the decision boundaries in a common direction to isolate the region(s) of feature space corresponding to the common label. Therefore, rather than the ""highly gerrymandered"" regions of output space corresponding to the overfitting case, this consistent error feedback will nudge the decision boundaries in a common direction for all samples having the same label-to-feature-set correspondence, leading to a single (or maybe few) large region(s) of feature space having been isolated corresponding to the common label, therefore providing good generalization.So, what is wrong with the above mental model of what is going on in a neural net to achieve generalization, and if nothing (other than lack of detail) then can we be more specific about what step of this training process is surprising rather than inevitable?I suppose this explanation could also be cast in terms of optimal decision boundaries, the same as an SVM, since the boundaries are only going to move as far as they need to minimize the errors. Once all samples are correctly predicted the errors will go to zero and the boundaries will stop moving.",NEG

Unlike most other machines, they can traverse extremely complex environments at high speeds. To date, only expert human pilots have been able to fully exploit their capabilities. Autonomous operation with onboard sensing and computation has been limited to low speeds. State-of-the-art methods generally separate the navigation problem into subtasks: sensing, mapping, and planning. Although this approach has proven successful at low speeds, the separation it builds upon can be problematic for high-speed navigation in cluttered environments. The subtasks are executed sequentially, leading to increased processing latency and a compounding of errors through the pipeline. Here, we propose an end-to-end approach that can autonomously fly quadrotors through complex natural and human-made environments at high speeds with purely onboard sensing and computation. The key principle is to directly map noisy sensory observations to collision-free trajectories in a receding-horizon fashion. This direct mapping drastically reduces processing latency and increases robustness to noisy and incomplete perception. The sensorimotor mapping is performed by a convolutional network that is trained exclusively in simulation via privileged learning: imitating an expert with access to privileged information. By simulating realistic sensor noise, our approach achieves zero-shot transfer from simulation to challenging real-world environments that were never experienced during training: dense forests, snow-covered terrain, derailed trains, and collapsed buildings. Our work demonstrates that end-to-end policies trained in simulation enable high-speed autonomous flight through challenging environments, outperforming traditional obstacle avoidance pipelines.",NEG

Basically, many sparse highly parallelizable reference frames that build a predictive world model. I found a lot of hierarchical rnn research papers and a lot of multi agent rnn research papers but nothing that seems to attempt to build something like what I would imagine would be possible. What I'm asking for here is a sanity check. Does this make sense and could it be something worth spending cycles on?My imagined implementation would be a model that has an actor-critic model for itself. When it encounters something new it builds a new actor-critic model and places that model on a latent space where the location in that latent space is determined by the perceived similarity to other models that have been placed in that space. The weights of this new model would be instantiated to be similar to the models in a similar location in the latent space. I'm currently imagining the similarity metric would either be determined by some self-supervised learner based on perceived characteristics and/or would just be updated based on actor weights. If the observed reference frame is sufficiently similar to another one of the models then observations with respect to it are applied to that old reinforcement learner instead of a new one being created.At this point it will be possible to in theory build a representation of what any specific object the agent encounters will do by itself by letting each model predict it's next state. You would update the models you are actively observing when they do something unexpected. The next step is to add the ability to pass references to the other models to each other to allow the reference frames to interact with each other. This could be done by giving reference frame 1 the location in the latent space of reference frame 2 along with reference frame 2’s expected action state and world state into the input of the reference frame 1 RNN.Now the agent will be able to develop causal maps of the environment including themselves. To build long chains of these causal maps will still run into catastrophic forgetting but making it so groups of reference frames can be represented as a single reference frame with methods similar to hierarchical reinforcement learning should make it possible to build long complex causal theories about how objects interact.What’s more, the vast majority of the time any given reference frame will not be used and it isn’t tightly coupled to a central algorithm so you can save the network state and shut down networks you aren't using. This means you only should ever be working with a small set of highly specialized models at a time that are very good at predicting what the current relevant world state will do next while also being able to store a massive amount of accurate world state without having to constantly be dealing with a monolithic network. My hope is such a system would ultimately be large, but fairly compute efficient and be better at understanding causality which in turn would make one-shot learning more tenable.So what do ya think? Is this insane and overly complex? Any existing research you know of that might shed light on any of pieces of this? Think it might work? Obviously this would be damn hard to pull off even if it would, I'm fine with that.If you think this wouldn't work I would love to know why.Edit: Cool upvotes. Wasn't really expecting that.

The market swarms with data-related jobs for all tastes, so sometimes it's really easy to confuse one with another.If the multiplicity of data roles still puzzles you, I’ll be glad to navigate you among the most popular ones.# Must-have Skillset to Start a Data CareerBefore I start listing the highly demanded data professions, I’d also like to briefly describe the basic skill set required for these roles, which you should learn before sending your CV to potential employers.To cut a long story short, your checklist to enter the data industry should include Python, SQL, and Microsoft Excel. Trust me, you’ll hear these buzzwords at every interview :)In addition, it’s a good idea to supply your armory with Data Visualization and Data Cleaning skills in order to unlock the door to a greater data career.# Most Popular Data Roles: Who’s Who* **Data Analyst*****Key Focus***\*: Performs analysis of business data to find beneficial opportunities.\*In fact, no company can do without a Data Analyst, but their job titles usually vary from company to company. Depending on the industry specifics, you may come across such titles as ""Business Analyst"", ""Business Intelligence Analyst"", ""Healthcare Data Analyst"" and so on,  but most of them relate to similar functionality.As a rule, Data Analysts are engaged in collecting and analyzing data, as well as reporting outcomes to the company’s management in order to prioritize needs and target business strategies.* **Data Engineer*****Key Focus:*** *Optimizes the infrastructure supporting the data analytics workflow.*Data Engineers are responsible for building and testing optimal ecosystems that ensure worry-free data processing and the running of different algorithms. Every piece of technology goes out of date and needs regular upgrades, so Data Engineers make sure that the current version of the system or platform is the most efficient one.Apart from hands-on experience with programming languages such as Java, C++, and NoSQL, this position requires the ability to work with data APIs and ETL tools.* **Database Developer*****Key Focus:*** *Ensures the proper functioning of databases.*Since databases are subject to processing massive datasets and experiencing high loads, Database Developers provide the full cycle of DB maintenance, from modifying to backups and recoveries, in addition to designing and developing new databases.Additionally, the Database Developer workload includes ​​ensuring that all new business projects meet the existing database standards, and creating IT documentation.* **Data Architect*****Key Focus:*** *Creates the guidelines for data management within the company.*The main goal of a Data Architect is to identify the end-use of the databases existing in the company. By writing detailed blueprints for all employees, Data Architects help to successfully coordinate the database integration, development, and testing as well as protect them according to the most contemporary security measures.The most in-demand Data Architects should possess in-depth expertise in database structure and requirements, data mining, and segmentation techniques.* **Data Scientist*****Key Focus:*** *Offers actionable business solutions and predictions through leveraging AI.*In fact, the majority of Data Scientists start their careers as Data Analysts. Speaking of the transition, the requirements that allow a Data Analyst to enter the data “Ivy League” include mastering advanced programming skills and mathematics, as well as learning how to implement Machine Learning solutions.Data Scientists are expected to collect data in order to perform predictive analysis, even on unstructured (unlabeled) datasets. They detect patterns and trends, and provide data-driven insights that can improve the decision-making process within the company.* **Chief Data Officer (CDO)*****Key Focus:*** *Leads the data workflows across the enterprise.*By crafting data strategy and overseeing data management, CDOs ensure data quality and find ways of driving business processes in the right direction. As a CDO, you are engaged in establishing a “data-driven” culture that streamlines data sharing among the employees and making informed decisions on how to get more satisfying business outcomes.# To Sum UpMore and more businesses nowadays increasingly recognize that they store treasure troves of data that, properly utilized, can be a great competitive advantage and bring value. As such, there has never been a better time to enter the data field because the demand for data specialists is skyrocketing, and organizations are willing to pay those who are able to convert data into a powerful business weapon handsomely.",POS

So I threw one together and I'm posting it here in case anyone else might find it useful. Usage and examples are in the source code link above.Since I use PyCharm to edit and run my notebooks, the engine is set up to work with how PyCharm uses cell metadata. It shouldn’t be too hard to extend this for non-PyCharm notebooks, editing the cell metadata directly might be enough (standard Jupyter editor allows this, albeit its a bit clunky), or feel free to fork the project to create your own custom parser.Even though it’s  pretty basic (the core logic is only \~100 lines of code), it worked well for my use case which included chaining templates (i.e. templates generating other templates).  A few final notes. This is not an announcement of a new package/library, it’s just code I put together for a problem that I couldn’t ""google"" myself out of. As such, the code isn’t what I consider high quality, but it does the job for me.Other things I looked into that didn’t quite do what I wanted:* [jupytemplate](https://github.com/xtreamsrl/jupytemplate): This required installing an jupyter notebook extension and didn’t support chaining templates (as far as I could tell).* [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): Although having the notebook paired to a normal python file has advantages, and I could probably change the templating into the regular python domain, it would create more overhead than benefit for my use case.If there's any other templating solutions out there I'd be interested in taking a look as well.**tldr**: Github repo of code I threw together to solve a templating need that might be useful to others facing a similar need. ",POS

Today I was trying out different classifiers for a multi-label task and wanted to get a baseline using different sklearn classifiers. While I was programming and waiting for the program to finish I wondered if there is a GitHub repo that has implemented all the classifiers with evaluation metrics / graphics and so on. I searched for a bit but I have not found any yet. I know some classifiers are task-dependent and the input varies as well but generally I would say that it is possible to implement a script that tests all the classifiers and returns the best 3 with their evaluations. One would get a good baseline for the task at hand and could fine-tune the classifiers if he wanted to. If you know of any implementations I would appreciate it. I might implement it myself for future projects because it would be really helpful to have a comparison and baseline  between a custom neural network / transformer and the best sklearn algorithms for the tasks.

Our hopes are that LIVECell will provide a valuable resource to the cell biology-community as well as an interesting benchmark for the machine learning-community. LIVECell is published under the CC-BY-NC 4.0-license making it freely available for non-commercial purposes.**Why should we care about cell segmentation?** Microscopic images of two-dimensional cell cultures like the ones in LIVECell are extremely commonly used in cell biology-research making them important tools during development of new medicines. Microscopic imaging is cheap and accessible and provides high detail in both space and time, even at the individual cell level. Cell instance segmentation can however be difficult due to low contrast, weird object shapes and high object density. So, we need high-performing instance segmentation-models and datasets to train them to help researchers use microscopy to find new medicines in a faster and cheaper way.**Some things we learned from a machine learning-perspective** (although we have not done any systematic ML-study yet):* The two models we trained on LIVECell achieved similar mask AP to what they achieved on MS COCO, which indicates that the two datasets are somewhat similar in overall difficulty.* Our two models achieve similar mask AP but differ in terms of average false negative ratio (Fig 3). We have not yet investigated the cause of this difference.* The different cell types morphologies vary in difficulty but neuronal-like cell types with their highly non-convex morphologies (image in post) are really tricky to segment well using standard instance segmentation models.* Due to the large number of objects per image (average \~300, up to 3000+), LIVECell poses an interesting challenge for computational efficient instance segmentation models (Fig S11).* We also stress test our models on even higher object densities, finding that our best model in terms of mask AP collapses whereas the other model extrapolates a fair bit (Fig 4). Our hypothesis is that this difference may be due to the different prediction mechanisms (anchor-based/free).* Although all images in LIVECell are from the same instrument, models trained on it transfer very well to others given appropriate image preprocessing (Fig S12-13). We even establish new state-of-the-art on a previously published cell segmentation-dataset without training on its images (Fig S12). **Links*** Link to dataset: [https://sartorius-research.github.io/LIVECell/](https://sartorius-research.github.io/LIVECell/)* Open access paper: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01249-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01249-6)* Papers with code: [https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/livecell](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/livecell)* Github: [https://github.com/sartorius-research/LIVECell](https://github.com/sartorius-research/LIVECell)",POS

If you don't know what that is, then it is a machine learning technique for studying unknown dynamical systems from collections of their trajectories. The method intertwines operator theory, data science, and dynamical systems theory, and also intersects a good deal with control theory. **It is a great little place to explore new operator theoretic methods from a pure mathematical standpoint, and to use operator theory tools to answer questions in machine learning.****I have an introductory lecture here**, for those that are interested: [https://youtu.be/\_qjSprLvGS0](https://youtu.be/_qjSprLvGS0)My colleagues and I have been picking apart the field for the past two or three years, and over the last year or so we have made a lot of significant strides. There has been a lot of work surrounding DMD that uses Koopman operators, which play very well with Ergodic theory. That means if you were to restrict yourself to L\^1 or L\^p, then there is some hope of recovering at least one eigenfunction from the Koopman operator through the Birkhoff and Von Neumann Ergodic Theorems. This is largely the approach the Igor Mezic and his colleagues have taken in the exploration of ""Koopmanism.""However, *Koopman operators truly correspond to discrete time systems*, and necessarily, if you are going to study a continuous time system using those operators, then *you need a system that is discretizable*. This means you need a system that is forward invariant or forward complete (where the former is a statement about sets and the latter about dynamics). One approach to verify forward completeness is to have a global Lipschitz condition, which means that your system would need to be bounded globally by a linear system.We just had a paper accepted to the Journal of Nonlinear Science (arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03977](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03977)), which uses occupation kernels and Liouville Operators (a generalization of Koopman generators) to *access the continuous time dynamics directly*, without worrying about discretizations. This means that we can study a wider class of dynamics with our methods, and can leverage observed data that comes from systems that admit finite escape times, such as x' = 1+x\^2 (i.e. tangent functions). I give an outline of the method here: [https://youtu.be/xfZG0mhKd0s](https://youtu.be/xfZG0mhKd0s)But unfortunately, **DMD methods as they are right now are strictly heuristic**. The best convergence guarantees that are out there involve the Strong Operator Topology, which doesn't give spectral convergence. DMD is a spectral method, and so *the obtained models will not necessarily converge to the true underlying dynamics for your data.*The answer to this is fairly clear, *we need compact operator* to get norm convergence of the sequence of finite rank operators that we are approximating with. However, Koopman operator for deterministic systems are rarely compact, where even the simplest dynamics x' = 0 yield Koopman operators that are not compact (the identity operator).Our accepted manuscript also introduces a compact dynamic operator that is ""close"" to the unbounded Liouville operator in some sense, which we call the scaled Liouville operator. It is compact and sort of nudges the data an infinitesimal amount.However, we have better results coming down the line, and we have an arXiv publication that gives a truly compact operator for doing DMD. It's tricky to use, and so I've been expanding my YouTube series to dive into it a bit. This month, I'm going to release another video that will outline the Singular DMD method. To get started, I put this together, which gives an introduction to compact operators and their spectral theory: [https://youtu.be/Bqz73NQ5XaQ](https://youtu.be/Bqz73NQ5XaQ)**I always value the contributions from this community, and you all have helped me catch some errors in my own work.

In this article, we show a model to implement this principle accurately with spatio-temporal local, spike-based, and continuous-time learning rules.A long misunderstanding is that because the distribution of the stimulus x is usually unknown, it is impossible to calculate the mutual information between x and the corresponding representation y, and so we can not maximize I(x ; y) accurately.

Think autosklearn, auto gluoan, auto h2o, pycaret, etc.I'm doing this for selfish reasons (benchmarking of an automatic ml tool I'm working on). However, I'm open-sourcing every single dataset for which I can find an open license and the runtime environment. The RE is pretty dumb, it just does on-machine parallelism based on the nr of GPUs, but in principle, I should be able to implement multi-machine parallelism soon.At any rate, the issue I have with other such benchmarks (e.g. openML) is that they are too myopic in terms of problem-space. They boil down to classification, or at most classification and regression, based on categorical and numerical features.There is indeed a problem with a large benchmark suite, in that it can't run very large problems due to compute limitations (e.g. image net, translation tasks with an associated learning corpus, protein folding, DICOM classification, etc). However, I don't feel like that should limit it to only the most basics of tasks that can fit in a standard CSV.In my current implementation I've added:- Datasets with text inputs (mixed with date, numeric and categorical inputs)- Datasets with image inputs (mixed with categorical labels, think cifrar100 but feed the superclass + image and have it predict the class)- Timeseries data (where there's an ordering of and relation between all rows of the dataset)On the other hand, this seems to just be scratching the surface of what auto ml should be doing and I'm curious to find more datasets that represent complex problems *but* are not so large as to be computationally unviable to run with a startup budget (or with an individual researcher budget, since that's my goal for this suite).Hence why I'd like to focus on ""neglected"" areas first, since I assume they might actually harbour a lot of datasets for which auto ml techniques could provide real help. As opposed to, say, image classification, which is a nice point of comparison, but realistically you're competing against teams of dozens, building models that run across million-dollar clusters, so you're never touching the edge.Some ideas that come to mind, but for which I haven't found datasets:- Equation solving (text to text or text to number)- Images augmented with text (e.g. x-ray + doctor diagnosis)- Predicting numbers/classes from niche ""imaging"" formats where the typical network might not work well (e.g. electron diffraction patterns, or something else where the proximity of pixels doesn't ""mean"" what it means in macroscopic photography)- Any sort of mixed numeric/categoric and multimedia format (e.g. song recognition identification *but* with the genre or name of the band as an input)- Self-referential / graph datasets (e.g. text with a lot of hyperlinks to other parts of the page)- Non-text, non-multimedia sequences of arbitrary size and high-variance magnitude as either inputs or output- ""Typical"" classification or regression problems where ""traditional"" methods (e.g. boosting, random forests, regressions, plain TDs, clustering, SVMs or even normal MLPs) work poorly for some poorly understood reasons, not being able to outperform humans or not being able to outperform hand-crafted equations- Equation optimization aka parameter finding/tweaking (in cases where just running SGD on the equation themselves is impossible or practically impossible)But again, this is me spit-balling and I haven't really found good examples of such datasets.Also, I might be completely missing the mark as to what's ""interesting"" for generic supervised machine learning to tackle, what classes of problems this would work best for. So I'm curious what other people would think are the interesting niches I should focus my benchmarking on.Note for the pednatic: I get that ""computational budget"" varies 1000x based on the method being used and when you call quits (i.e. assume the model has converged to the best solution it's likely to obtain best on some validation data), but still, input size and a number of rows matter (although, again, I get that even those can be relative due to how you prepare/pre-encode/encode the data and because you can do sampling). But I think the framing still ""makes sense"" even if it has this inherent nebulosity.",POS

I have quite a lot of domain knowledge as well, so I find it somewhat easy to do feature engineering for this problem.I'm having some trouble making a ''strong'' decision maker from the data though. I think there is a few tough problems as part of the problem that make it hard.If poker is new to you, the distribution of results looks like this: If you and an opponent have gambled $100 each, the final outcomes will be either +$100 or -$100. And depending on the features, the likelihood of each outcome changes.  So in any given situation, the actual outcome might be -$100 or +$100, but the expected value might be +$5. I feel like the nature of this data makes some performance ''scores'' of a model misleading?   For some context on the current status of where I'm at - I've used a random forest regressor with some engineered features, and the 5 different decisions you can make in poker had scores of like:  Bet: 0.70, Check: 0.70, Fold: 0.99, Call: 0.70, Raise: 0.65.  Folding is very easy to predict as it is always a negative outcome, and it's basically half of the total gambled amount. Then the other actions I would expect to be harder to predict, so it all makes sense.There are a couple of problems I have with the random forest regressor:Feature designing (mostly when the pot is a chop pot, where the players tie - I think that is causing some bad judgement in some situations). There is also some incorrect derivations from the information (maybe it's a form of bias?). Basically in the training data there are situations where I would only make the play with a ''strong hand'' and the outcome was positive. Then in training, because there were no similar decisions with a ''weak hand'' and a strongly negative outcome (because it would be a terrible play I wouldn't do it), the model thinks that if 95% of the features are the same (except for the most important one, the hand strength!), it still thinks it will get a big win. Which is not true. It seems like it needs the experience of making a lot of ''bad'' decisions so that it can make that distinction. I'm not sure how to handle this - either embark on a self learning AI in a sandbox environment where it can learn from scratch making every possible decision. I also tried doing a ''bike stabiliser'' approach. Basically limiting the options available to the AI if certain criteria weren't met. So the program was not allowed to Raise without a hand of certain strength (because it was bluffing too much in bad situations).Then more generally - I've tried doing feature engineering + random forest regressor. Which is somewhat good - it's a good proof of concept. But I'm not sure if I should try a neural network solution with much less feature engineering and see if it can figure this stuff out for itself?I'm basically not sure what the next step should be for me to make this project a success.If anyone knows some good solutions for regression problems with data of this nature (large positive and negative scores, with an expected value in between them). Whereas predicting car value / stock price the values are much closer together.&#x200B;I think another drawback from the random forest regressor is that it can't extrapolate beyond what it has already seen in training. But it had the best performance compared to Linear regression and Logistic regression - so not sure what to do about that...",POS

Choosing an appropriate method is a crucial aspect for meaningful counterfactual explanations. As documented in recent reviews, there exists a quickly growing literature with available methods. Yet, in the absence of widely available open–source implementations, the decision in favour of certain models is primarily based on what is readily available. Going forward – to guarantee meaningful comparisons across explanation methods – we present CARLA (Counterfactual And Recourse Library), a python library for benchmarking counterfactual explanation methods across both different data sets and different machine learning models. In summary, our work provides the following contributions: (i) an extensive benchmark of 11 popular counterfactual explanation methods, (ii) a benchmarking framework for research on future counterfactual explanation methods, and (iii) a standardized set of integrated evaluation measures and data sets for transparent and extensive comparisons of these methods. We have open sourced CARLA and our experimental results on [GitHub](https://github.com/carla-recourse/CARLA), making them available as competitive baselines.

But the authors of the paper argue that this is, *most likely,* not the case:>We argue that this optimization difficulty is unlikely to be caused by vanishing gradients. These plain networks are trained with BN \[16\], which ensures forward propagated signals to have non-zero variances. We also verify that the backward propagated gradients exhibit healthy norms with BN. So neither forward nor backward signals vanish. In fact, the 34-layer plain net is still able to achieve compet- itive accuracy (Table 3), suggesting that the solver works to some extent. We conjecture that the deep plain nets may have exponentially low convergence rates, which impact the reducing of the training error3. The reason for such optimization difficulties will be studied in the future.I will refer to this as the **“ResNet Hypothesis”**.Many recent papers and tutorials appear to be *assuming* that the ResNet Hypothesis is **false.** I have read numerous papers in which the authors add skip connections in order to *“improve gradient flow”* and they cite the original ResNet paper to support this claim. While it is quite plausible that adding skip connections will improve gradient flow, what caused the degradation problem in the **first place**? The idea that skip connections solve the degradation problem by improving gradient flow seems to be in *clear contradiction* with the ResNet Hypothesis; so where did this idea come from? ***Has the ResNet Hypothesis been*** ***~~debunked~~*** ***falsified******?***Edit  1 - I think this is an accurate representation of the average DL researcher’s (myself included) understanding of why ResNets work \[based on u/impossiblefork’s  [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/px3hzd/comment/hekymwd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]:https://preview.redd.it/wbvvkwlrd8q71.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b3cac7d8baea007d9dd379ce67020a5a65e2c9bEdit 2 - Apologies for using the word ”debunked” in the original post.

The purpose of these methods is to be able to compare, say, two runs of the same model with different initializations, or two different models. Here are two particular papers:[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07543.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07543.pdf)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00414.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00414.pdf)I'm hoping to see if anyone can confirm if my understanding is correct. The problem with directly comparing the weights of two models with different initializations is that the correspondence of the weights of these two models is not necessarily the same; that is, the features that are learned at a particular layer in the network need not ""line up"". From the first paper, Section 3: ""Due to symmetries in the architecture and weight initialization procedures, for any given parameter vector that is found, one could create many equivalent solutions simply by permuting the unit orders within a layer (and permuting the outgoing weights accordingly).""The way that I make sense of this is that in convolutional layers, a single output channel is computed by taking the convolution of all the input channels and the corresponding kernel (plus bias). Thus, the sum operation over all channels and kernel dimensions essentially mixes up all the information, so that any permutation of those channels would yield the same output channel. Is this correct?If this is the case, I'm confused about how the second paper works. In there proposed similarity metric, they essentially look at the activation maps that result from N different example inputs, and create an NxN (cosine) similarity matrix which represents how similar each example's corresponding activation map is to all the other example's activation maps. From their paper, Section 3: ""Our key insight is that instead of comparing multivariate features of an example in the two representations (e.g. via regression), one can first measure the similarity between every pair of examples in each representation separately, and then compare the similarity structures.""Why is it that these similarity structures can be directly compared when the weights of the network cannot, as explained in the first paper? Since the similarity structures are computed from the feature maps, does this imply that feature maps share correspondence across different networks? Why can't two networks learn a different ordering of feature maps for a particular layer? Thanks in advance for any insights.",POS

From the paper,>""One of the challenges of predicting high-dimensional data is that unimodal losses such as mean-squared error and cross-entropy are not very useful, and powerful conditional generative models which need to reconstruct every detail in the data are usually required. But these models are computationally intense, and waste capacity at modeling the complex relationships in the data x, often ignoring the context c. For example, images may contain thousands of bits of information while the high-level latent variables such as the class label contain much less information (10 bits for 1,024 categories). This suggests that modeling p(x|c) directly may not be optimal for the purpose of extracting shared information between x and c.""Given the context that this paper focuses on time-series prediction, I have a couple questions about this motivation.1. By ""conditional generative models"" are they referring to models like CGANs?2. Why would modeling p(x|c) not promote shared information between x and c? I think I understand their example when the context contains less information, but if a generative model was conditioned on higher-dimensional data, would it necessarily ignore that context as well?",NEG

This type of information is not present by default on a typical network sniffer - but timestamps are.I've seen a few colleagues just using the timestamps of each network packet as input in the RNN, but isn't this irrelevant? How is the Neural Network gonna work with timestamps when they are literally an ever growing number that never repeats itself? I know we can reduce the number for faster processing but even so it doesn't make sense to me.In my head, what makes sense is implementing something like a counter for packets with the same origin\_IP-destination\_IP pair that resets after something like a few minutes without another hit. This way, the neural network can use the number of times similar traffic has happened as an efficient input. I know this will probably add too much overhead processing in the program logic but a problem at a time lolAm I wrong about assuming that a RNN doesn't care about timestamps as an input? Also, if I simply don't use any temporal or counter reference as an input, will the RNN correctly guess if the traffic is malicious? (in the denial of service scenario).Sorry if I'm missing something basic, haven't worked with neural networks for long. Thanks!",POS

I am currently involved in a PhD position which involves ML, but is heavily application focused - I am looking for advice from the ML community for my situation. In our lab, we have two positions for the project I am involved in. The two positions involve two different domains with just a slight overlap. The other position for this project did not produce usable results or was vacant for a long time, so I had to do tasks for both positions for this project. Note that the project itself is heavily application focused. The task we currently carry out do not involve any ML research which is worth of a publication in a noteworthy conference. I am strongly considering quitting this position, as even though I have a new colleague, I still get immense pressure from project partners (mostly private companies) to participate / fix studies of the other domain, for which my collegague is primarely responsible. This leaves almost no room to produce research in my area which can be published in an ML conference on top of my project work. The pressure of project partners  also negatively affects my mental health, as they like to put the blame on us if there is a lack of progress in the project. This is unfortunate for me, because I wanted to work as an ML researcher in the future, for which an PhD position is a somewhat hard requirement. I've also read that PhD positions in ML are hard to come by, e.g., one can wait for several years until one gets accepted in a suitable position. So if I would quit this position, realistically, I would work some years as an ML engineer while looking for other PhD positions.I wanted to ask if quitting an ML PhD would be a hard pass for other ML PhD positions.

The inaurance company processes insurance claims. Let's say there are 100 people working at the insurance company: everyday, new claims arrive and existing claims are settled - but there is always a backlog.In terms of strategies, the insurance company is considering hiring new employees: they are thinking of 5 new employees (strategy 1: costs $ 200,000), 10 new employees (strategy 2 : costs $ 500,000) or 15 new employees (strategy 3: costs $ 700,000).The logic being, perhaps more employees could result in: fewer backlog through out the year, faster processing time of claims or smaller payouts to the claim filers (e.g. lets assume that each claim has to be processed in under 30 days, if a claim is approaching 30 days - the insurance company tries to negotiate and pay 50% of the amount owed instead of the whole amount).In terms of the ""transitions"", different options can be considered:A) The amount of backlog in the system (e.g. state A = less than 100 claims, state B = 101 to 200 claims, state C = more than 300 claims). Using existing data,  transition matrix can be made to construct this transition matrix (3 × 3).B) The average number of days spent on a claim (e.g. state A = less than 10 days , state B = 11 days to 25 days, state C = more than 25 claims). Using existing data,  transition matrix can be made to construct this transition matrix (3 × 3)C) The average percentage of the full amount saved on a case (e.g. state A = insurance company pays on average pays less than 50% of cases on average , state B = pays between 51% and 75% , state C = pays more than 75%). Using existing data,  transition matrix can be made to construct this transition matrix (3 × 3).My question is: I understand how to run a simulation that shows on any given day, which state the transition matrix (i.e. markov chain) will be in. Question 1: But how can you calculate the cost and benefit (utility) of being in state A, state B and State C? I thought of adding integer scores to each state (e.g. state A = +3, state B = +2, state C = +1). Assuming that its always more advantageous to be in state, you run the simulation for 100 days and add the score on each day. A score 201 could mean that the system was on the whole ""healthier"" than the system with a score of 167. Is there another way of doing this?Question 2: I know the cost of each strategy. But how do you attribute a benefit to each strategy? The best I can think about is trying to look at the historical data available and try to look at the system statistics when more people were hired vs less people.Can someone please provide some advice on this? In general, am I understand the use of cost-benefit simulation correctly? Could this simulation serve as a legitimate method to decide which strategy to select?Thanks!",POS

Unlike existing approaches that explicitly integrate prior knowledge about the task, we simply cast object detection as a language modeling task conditioned on the observed pixel inputs. Object descriptions (e.g., bounding boxes and class labels) are expressed as sequences of discrete tokens, and we train a neural net to perceive the image and generate the desired sequence. Our approach is based mainly on the intuition that if a neural net knows about where and what the objects are, we just need to teach it how to read them out. Beyond the use of task-specific data augmentations, our approach makes minimal assumptions about the task, yet it achieves competitive results on the challenging COCO dataset, compared to highly specialized and well optimized detection algorithms.",POS

The simplest thing which comes to my mind is fixing some neighbourhood and then doing multiple linear regression, so the color (I take one-dimensional color values as the video seems to be basically a heatmap) of a pixel in the next frame is an affine linear transformation of the colors of its neighbours in the current frame.  Then I'd sample the neighbourhood in multiple, random rotations, apply my model on each and take the mean.The problem with this approach is that I basically just integrate some rings around the pixel of various diameters, which means the model couldn't distinguish a gray pixel sitting on the border between a black area and a white area from a gray pixel sitting in a gray area.  I thought about also incorporating products of the color values, e.g. if the neighbours of `x` are `x, y, x`, I would try to fit a model of the form `f(t + 1, x) = dot(β, [1.0, f(t, x), f(t, y), f(t, z), f(t, x) * f(t, x), f(t, x) * f(t, y) * ... * f(t, z) * f(t, z)])` where `β` is a vector of length 10 in this case.Does that make any sense?

To model the relationship between images and text, most multimodal Visio-linguistic models today rely on large datasets. Historically, these datasets were created by either manually captioning images or crawling the web and extracting the alt-text as the caption. While the former method produces higher-quality data, the intensive manual annotation process limits the amount of data produced. The automated extraction method can result in larger datasets. However, it requires either heuristics and careful filtering to ensure data quality or scaling-up models to achieve robust performance. To overcome these limitations, Google research team created a high-quality, large-sized, multilingual dataset called [the Wikipedia-Based Image Text (WIT) Dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit).

I see these concepts being used a lot in IT and Tech applications, for example - computers learning to play video games like ""tetris"" and ""mario"". But can these concepts be applied in everyday settings? &#x200B;For example,&#x200B;**Problem 1:** Suppose there is a grocery store owner who has some leftover money. With this money, the owner identifies a list of ""actions"" that can be taken:&#x200B;1) Do nothing and deposit the money in the bank (earn 2% interest a year)&#x200B;2) Hire more staff (this will cost money, but the owner believes that this will increase profits and the  staff will be able to complete more orders everyday, e.g. catering orders).&#x200B;3) Buy new cash registers (the existing cash registers are old, and the owner believes that since newer machines will be able to accept credit cards, they will speed up the lines and increase profits)&#x200B;4) Renovate the store (this will cost money, but revamping the store will make it look more attractive and increase profits)&#x200B;5) Hire a consultant ( the will cost money, but the consultant might be able to offer some advice that can increase profits)&#x200B;6) Consider expanding the variety of products that are being offered (this will also cost money, but this could attract new customers and increase profits).&#x200B;Suppose the owner has detailed historical information on all transactions made in the grocery store, all operating costs, all profits, and the number of customers that pass through his store. Also, the owner knows how much each of these ""Actions"" will approximately cost, but he does not know how much profit they will result in.&#x200B; Can the owner somehow use ""Markov Simulations and Markov Decision Process"" to figure out which of these actions he should take (i.e. how should he spend his money in the next year) ? How exactly would he do this? &#x200B;**Problem 2:**&#x200B;Based on the number of transactions and expiry dates, can the owner use ""Markov Simulations and Markov Decision Process"" on a daily basis to figure out an optimal way to decide :&#x200B;\- Which products to reorder and how many units to reorder (e.g. more or less) and what price to sell them at?&#x200B;\- Which products to discontinue?&#x200B;\- Which new products to acquire and what price to sell them at?&#x200B;For example, suppose the owner decides to order more soda drinks because it's the summer. If he orders too much and it doesn't sell, at least the soda won't go bad. He can just hold on to it and get rid off it over the next few months. However, he might have been able to use that money he spent on soda on some other product which would have earned him more profits - the soda didn't make him lose existing profits in the long run, but rather lose potential profits.&#x200B;However, if the owner orders too much turkey on thanksgiving and it doesn't sell - it might all expire and he might completely lose profits before he can even sell it at a discounted rate. But the profit margins on turkey could be more than soda drinks - but soda drinks has a lower risk. If the owner decides to be conservative and only order some turkey - if all the turkey sells and customers want more, he loses out on some profit. But ordering less turkeys provided they don't all sell - he loses less money. The possibilities are endless.&#x200B;In short, could the owner use Markov Simulations and Markov Decision Process for this problem? In this problem, the list of actions are much bigger than the previous problem (e.g. 6 actions vs many actions). I understand that Markov Simulations require somehow ""mapping"" expected rewards to each action based on the ""state"" that the system will be in. I am not sure how to define states in this problem (e.g. an infinite large matrix that describes consumer patterns, e.g. ""high turkey demand and high soda demand"", ""low turkey demand and high soda demand"", ""high turkey demand and low soda demand"", ""low turkey demand and low soda demand"".... now imagine this for 100 items). I suppose that with enough historical data, a Markov Chain can be made that describes these transitions, but for practical measures this Markov Chain will probably need to be collapsed (e.g. ""high meat demand and high drink demand""). &#x200B;Can someone please suggest how Markov Simulations and Markov Decision Process can be used to solve this problem?&#x200B;Thanks!(sorry for the long post)",POS

My intuition leads me to believe, then, that (unconditioned) inference for a decoder-only model uses an effective sequence length of 1 (the most recently produced token is the only real input that requires computation on), making Attention a linear-complexity operation. This thinking seems to be validated by this [github issue](https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers/issues/29), and [this paper (2nd paragraph of Introduction)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04779.pdf).This of course doesn't invalidate the quadratic complexity issue for the non-autoregressive case (e.g. BERT), but I'm wondering why more papers don't point out that this problem doesn't exist at inference time for autoregressive models like GPT-3? Even the [Sparse Attention paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/Sparse_Transformer/sparse_transformers.pdf) (almost 400 citations) says that>""We consider the task of autoregressive sequence generation .... the self-attention portion of the network must compute n weightings for each of n elements, however, which can quickly become intractable as the sequence length grows.

The way it got its start was by looking at high dimensional systems, and stacking the snapshots into a matrix that was decomposed later. The eigendecomposition of this matrix provided Dynamic Modes, which gave the dominant modes of the system.However, this approach is extremely limiting, where you can only have as many samples of your space as you have dimensions before you saturate the rank of the matrix. The led to the use of extended DMD methods, where the states were thrown into a high dimensional feature space. Inevitably, this gave rise to infinite dimensional feature spaces and Koopman operators, which is how the connections with reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces first came about.Our work has been towards expanding the scope of Dynamic Mode Decompositions, where our first manuscripts in the field removed the Koopman operator from the analysis, and instead used Liouville operators. By directly accessing these operators, we are removing the requirements that a system is discretizable (forward complete/invariant). But this still leverages operators of functions of the state.To further extend these ideas to include nonlocal operators within their scope, we need to operate on Hilbert Spaces composed of functions that send continuous signals or trajectories to signals and trajectories. By introducing spaces like these, we can now look at operators that are nonlocal, which includes second order dynamical systems as well as fractional order dynamical systems.  Have a watch!

Importantly, it requires very small training data sets, uses linear optimization, and thus requires minimal computing resources. However, the algorithm uses randomly sampled matrices to define the underlying recurrent neural network and has a multitude of metaparameters that must be optimized. Recent results demonstrate the equivalence of reservoir computing to nonlinear vector autoregression, which requires no random matrices, fewer metaparameters, and provides interpretable results.

Most of the recently proposed methods are based on deep learning, which require very large amounts of data compared to traditional methods. The performance of the deep learning methods are largely dependent on the data distribution they were trained on, and it is important to use data from the robot's actual operating domain during training. Therefore, it is not possible to rely on pre-built, generic datasets when deploying robots in real environments, creating a need for efficient data collection and annotation in the specific operating conditions the robots will operate in. The challenge is then: how do we reduce the cost of obtaining such datasets to a point where we can easily deploy our robots in new conditions, environments and to support new sensors? As an answer to this question, we propose a data annotation pipeline based on SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and 3D-to-2D geometry. The pipeline allows creating 3D and 2D bounding boxes, along with per-pixel annotations of arbitrary objects without needing accurate 3D models of the objects prior to data collection and annotation. Our results showcase almost 90% Intersection-over-Union (IoU) agreement on both semantic segmentation and 2D bounding box detection across a variety of objects and scenes, while speeding up the annotation process by several orders of magnitude compared to traditional manual annotation.",POS

Large pre-trained NN to have billions of parameters to train. It is computationally expensive to load or download these models.2. Here comes pruning and distillation. Both of these techniques try to eliminate parameters (weights) with very little drop in accuracy.3. If we want to prune weights when finetuning our model, then movement pruning works best for that. However, the time and space requirements to train these models again to drop unnecessary could be expensive.4. Here comes block pruning where it creates square blocks in the weight matrix and then tries to perform movement pruning on the blocks rather than weights.For an in-depth overview refer to the video explainer.If you like this content, do share it with friends and support the channel.

A popular application of genetic algorithms is to optimize the procedural placement of vector graphic primitives to resemble a given painting. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also been proposed to generate procedural drawings, which can be optimized using gradient descent. In this work, we revisit the use of evolutionary algorithms for computational creativity. We find that modern evolution strategies (ES) algorithms, when tasked with the placement of shapes, offer large improvements in both quality and efficiency compared to traditional genetic algorithms, and even comparable to gradient-based methods. We demonstrate that ES is also well suited at optimizing the placement of shapes to fit the CLIP model, and can produce diverse, distinct geometric abstractions that are aligned with human interpretation of language.",POS

However, until now, these models could only produce output related to datasets they were trained on – which had limitations because there was usually less diversity among those files than what you would find when generating new ideas. A conventional GAN trained on images of cars shows impressive results when asked to generate other images of cars or automobiles. But the trained GAN will likely fail if given a flower or any object outside its automotive data set.Failure to show non-identical objects from the training dataset is a huge limitation, and it definitely needs to be resolved to meet the demand. Facebook is trying to solve the above problem by introducing [Instance-Conditioned GAN (IC-GAN)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ic_gan?). The [IC-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05070.pdf) is a new image generation model that can produce high-quality images with some input, even if it doesn’t appear in the training set. The unique thing about the IC-GAN model is that it can generate realistic, unforeseen image combinations—for example, a camel in snow or zebras running through an urban cityscape.It is no surprise that IC-GANs could be used to create visual examples for data sets with these new capabilities. This would allow artists and creators alike more expansive AI-generated content by creating art from photos or videos in the same way an artist might draw a picture using pencils and paintbrushes at their disposal.# [5 Min Read](https://www.marktechpost.com/2021/09/20/facebook-ai-introduces-a-new-image-generation-model-called-ic-gan-that-creates-high-quality-images-of-unfamiliar-objects-and-scenes/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05070?) | [Code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ic_gan?) | [Facebook Blog](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/instance-conditioned-gans/) &#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/l1f1ubcvmqo71.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf59a4f9c79b58a3dfca29a732ae05826e8a601e",POS

For a point **x**\_i = (x\_i, y\_i, z\_i) the uncertainty of point the x coordinate x\_i = +/- Δx, and similarily for the y and z coordinate. Moreover, points that have larger z-coordinates have larger amounts of uncertainty.I see three options:1. Adding noise using a normal distribution to the coordinates of the training points based on the uncertainty of the coordinates. Each epoch, sample from this distribution.2.

Yet one of the things they still can’t quite handle is scene compositionality, meaning that the model is not aware of the distinct objects that make up the scene. Object NeRF aims to tackle this issue using a dual-branch model that separately encodes the global context of the scene and each object in it. This approach not only reaches competitive levels of quality with current SOTA methods on static scenes but also enables object-level editing.

A patient can enter the hospital, and then meets the triage nurse. From there, they are sent to an examination room. If the condition is not serious, they are discharged from the hospital. If the condition is serious, they are sent to a proper hospital ward where they are kept there until they are discharged. However, if the patient enters the hospital in a very serious condition, then they are immediately sent to a ward and then discharged. I think that this problem can be modelled as a Markov Chain - either as a discrete time Markov Chain or as a continuous time Markov Chain. Using the available data, you can build a transition matrix which will describe the probabilities from moving between ""states"" (i.e. ""stages"") in the hospital. Once you have built the Markov Chain, you can calculate the probability the patient is in any of these ""states"" on the ""n-th"" day that they have entered the hospital.I am interested in something slightly different: When you look at this data, naturally you will see that the hospital does not admit only one patient at a time and then accept the second patient after the first patient has been discharged (i.e. dedicate the hospital to serving one patient at a time) - this would be crazy. Naturally, the hospital serves many patients - there are times when more patients might be transitioning between certain ""states"", and other times when fewer patients are transitioning between other ""states"". Naturally, the hospital can be more or less busy, and this will ultimately affect the ""speed"" at which patients will pass through the different ""stages"".Question: Can a Markov Chain be built in such a way that the transition probabilities are contingent on how many patients are in the hospital, how many patients are in each state and the rate at which they are transitioning? For instance, when a new patient arrives, the analysis could say: seeing as they are currently 100 patients in the hospital, 20 patients are waiting to see the triage nurse and 50 are in the exam room - the Markov Chain estimates you will have to wait approximately  10 hours before you might have your own room in the hospital ward?Is something like this possible?Thanks!",POS

OpenAI's recent blog about their DALL·E project shows the potential of models, but unfortunately, the model has not been released. As we know these state-of-the-art models require massive amounts of computation and parameters to train, our goal here with DALL·E mini is to show that one can still achieve reasonable performance on this multimodal task with far more accessible means of compute. Even though DALL·E mini is about 30 times smaller than the original and trained on a much smaller dataset, it demonstrates interesting zero-shot capabilities.  In this talk, we will get to know DALL·E mini in detail, and explain how it is capable of achieving such results thanks to the use of pre-trained models such as the VQ-GAN and BART. We will dig deeper into the theoretical aspects of these models to understand what happens under the hood in the DALL·E mini pipeline.*",POS

Later, executives called it ""Mario."" Both code names meant the same thing: a secret plan to break away from parent company Google.> > DeepMind feared Google might one day misuse its technology, and executives worked to distance the artificial-intelligence firm from its owner for years, said nine current and former employees who were directly familiar with the plans. > > This included plans to pursue an independent legal status that would distance the group's work from Google, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.> > One core tension at DeepMind was that it sold the business to people it didn't trust, said one former employee. ""Everything that happened since that point has been about them questioning that decision,"" the person added.> > Efforts to separate DeepMind from Google ended in April without a deal, The Wall Street Journal reported. The yearslong negotiations, along with recent shake-ups within Google's AI division, raise questions over whether the search giant can maintain control over a technology so crucial to its future.> > ""DeepMind's close partnership with Google and Alphabet since the acquisition has been extraordinarily successful — with their support, we've delivered research breakthroughs that transformed the AI field and are now unlocking some of the biggest questions in science,"" a DeepMind spokesperson said in a statement. ""Over the years, of course we've discussed and explored different structures within the Alphabet group to find the optimal way to support our long-term research mission. We could not be prouder to be delivering on this incredible mission, while continuing to have both operational autonomy and Alphabet's full support.""> > When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, the deal was seen as a win-win. Google got a leading AI research organization, and DeepMind, in London, won financial backing for its quest to build AI that can learn different tasks the way humans do, known as artificial general intelligence.> > But tensions soon emerged. Some employees described a cultural conflict between researchers who saw themselves firstly as academics and the sometimes bloated bureaucracy of Google's colossal business. Others said staff were immediately apprehensive about putting DeepMind's work under the control of a tech giant. For a while, some employees were encouraged to communicate using encrypted messaging apps over the fear of Google spying on their work.> > At one point, DeepMind's executives discovered that work published by Google's internal AI research group resembled some of DeepMind's codebase without citation, one person familiar with the situation said. ""That pissed off Demis,"" the person added, referring to Demis Hassabis, DeepMind's CEO. ""That was one reason DeepMind started to get more protective of their code.""> > After Google restructured as Alphabet in 2015 to give riskier projects more freedom, DeepMind's leadership started to pursue a new status as a separate division under Alphabet, with its own profit and loss statement, The Information reported.> > DeepMind already enjoyed a high level of operational independence inside Alphabet, but the group wanted legal autonomy too. And it worried about the misuse of its technology, particularly if DeepMind were to ever achieve AGI.> > Internally, people started referring to the plan to gain more autonomy as ""Watermelon,"" two former employees said. The project was later formally named ""Mario"" among DeepMind's leadership, these people said.> > ""Their perspective is that their technology would be too powerful to be held by a private company, so it needs to be housed in some other legal entity detached from shareholder interest,"" one former employee who was close to the Alphabet negotiations said. ""They framed it as 'this is better for society.'""> > In 2017, at a company retreat at the Macdonald Aviemore Resort in Scotland, DeepMind's leadership disclosed to employees its plan to separate from Google, two people who were present said.> > At the time, leadership said internally that the company planned to become a ""global interest company,"" three people familiar with the matter said. The title, not an official legal status, was meant to reflect the worldwide ramifications DeepMind believed its technology would have.> > Later, in negotiations with Google, DeepMind pursued a status as a company limited by guarantee, a corporate structure without shareholders that is sometimes used by nonprofits. The agreement was that Alphabet would continue to bankroll the firm and would get an exclusive license to its technology, two people involved in the discussions said. There was a condition: Alphabet could not cross certain ethical redlines, such as using DeepMind technology for military weapons or surveillance. > > In 2019, DeepMind registered a new company called DeepMind Labs Limited, as well as a new holding company, filings with the UK's Companies House showed. This was done in anticipation of a separation from Google, two former employees involved in those registrations said.> > Negotiations with Google went through peaks and valleys over the years but gained new momentum in 2020, one person said. A senior team inside DeepMind started to hold meetings with outside lawyers and Google to hash out details of what this theoretical new formation might mean for the two companies' relationship, including specifics such as whether they would share a codebase, internal performance metrics, and software expenses, two people said.> > From the start, DeepMind was thinking about potential ethical dilemmas from its deal with Google. Before the 2014 acquisition closed, both companies signed an ""Ethics and Safety Review Agreement"" that would prevent Google from taking control of DeepMind's technology, The Economist reported in 2019. Part of the agreement included the creation of an ethics board that would supervise the research. > > Despite years of internal discussions about who should sit on this board, and vague promises to the press, this group ""never existed, never convened, and never solved any ethics issues,"" one former employee close to those discussions said. A DeepMind spokesperson declined to comment.> > DeepMind did pursue a different idea: an independent review board to convene if it were to separate from Google, three people familiar with the plans said. The board would be made up of Google and DeepMind executives, as well as third parties. Former US president Barack Obama was someone DeepMind wanted to approach for this board, said one person who saw a shortlist of candidates.> > DeepMind also created an ethical charter that included bans on using its technology for military weapons or surveillance, as well as a rule that its technology should be used for ways that benefit society. In 2017, DeepMind started a unit focused on AI ethics research composed of employees and external research fellows. Its stated goal was to ""pave the way for truly beneficial and responsible AI."" > > A few months later, a controversial contract between Google and the Pentagon was disclosed, causing an internal uproar in which employees accused Google of getting into ""the business of war."" > > Google's Pentagon contract, known as Project Maven, ""set alarm bells ringing"" inside DeepMind, a former employee said. Afterward, Google published a set of principles to govern its work in AI, guidelines that were similar to the ethical charter that DeepMind had already set out internally, rankling some of DeepMind's senior leadership, two former employees said.> > In April, Hassabis told employees in an all-hands meeting that negotiations to separate from Google had ended. DeepMind would maintain its existing status inside Alphabet. DeepMind's future work would be overseen by Google's Advanced Technology Review Council, which includes two DeepMind executives, Google's AI chief Jeff Dean, and the legal SVP Kent Walker.> > But the group's yearslong battle to achieve more independence raises questions about its future within Google.> > Google's commitment to AI research has also come under question, after the company forced out two of its most senior AI ethics researchers. That led to an industry backlash and sowed doubt over whether it could allow truly independent research.> > Ali Alkhatib, a fellow at the Center for Applied Data Ethics, told Insider that more public accountability was ""desperately needed"" to regulate the pursuit of AI by large tech companies. > > For Google, its investment in DeepMind may be starting to pay off. Late last year, DeepMind announced a breakthrough to help scientists better understand the behavior of microscopic proteins, which has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery.> > As for DeepMind, Hassabis is holding on to the belief that AI technology should not be controlled by a single corporation. Speaking at Tortoise's Responsible AI Forum in June, he proposed a ""world institute"" of AI. Such a body might sit under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, Hassabis theorized, and could be filled with top researchers in the field. > > ""It's much stronger if you lead by example,"" he told the audience, ""and I hope DeepMind can be part of that role-modeling for the industry.""",POS

When dealing with a unique image, finding suitable training data that includes many samples of the same input-output pairing is often difficult. In some cases, when you use a large dataset to create your model, it may lead to unwanted outputs that do not preserve the specific characteristics of what was desired. Generative models like the ones used in neural networks can be trained to generate new images based on just one input. This exciting research direction holds the potential for these techniques to extend beyond basic image manipulation methods and create more unique art styles or designs with endless possibilities.

Here is my situation: I'm a phd student working on applying machine learning to concrete physical science problems and my committee includes some physical scientists who do not work on machine learning. I've tried my best to not use technical terms that may not familiar to these people and made my presentations as simple as possible. The issue is that some domain experts seem to find a hard time understanding the contributions and got lost in the presentation. I'm planning to include as much background as possible in my future presentations and focus on fewer projects so they won't get overwhelmed. I'm wondering if someone who has experienced similar situations could give me some suggestions on how to best convey the message during such presentations. &#x200B;Thanks!",POS

However, I’ve found that most tools are lacking when it comes to serving a large number of TensorFlow models, e.g. a model per user. So I’ve built my own tool, called TFServingCache, which automatically loads and unloads models in a distributed cluster of TensorFlow Serving instances.I’ve written a post about the project on medium: [TFServingCache: A distributed LRU-cache for serving TensorFlow models in Kubernetes](https://link.medium.com/lEeZEBkMBjb).The project is written in Go, and open source on GitHub: [TFServingCache](https://github.com/mKaloer/TFServingCache). Give it a try!",POS
