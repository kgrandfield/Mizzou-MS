Yay :)Had a lovely one month vacation in July were I regularly worked out, enjoyed life and recovered from the brutal exam phase.Now I started my job at a new company (Industrial air conditioning as commissioning engineer)I feel at home in the job since it's basically what I've been doing in my apprenticeship and worklife for 4 years.But:\- The pay is with 46k just basic. No one in my class makes less.\- As 100% field staff (which nobody wants to do, since living it a hotel everyweek is ... socially sacrificial) it feels very low. (I have confirmation from this from 5 other companies who offered me a position)\- They have a ridiculous clause on traveling. Say you have to stay on site for 4 weeks. You get payed to drive to the workplace and if you leave ... but if you wanna spent a weekend at home, you only get gas money and no time. One guy even told me, he fell sick and drove home only for the boss to tell him he won't get payed for the 3,5h drive\- Every coworker I asked about how the boss handles pay raises, clenched his jaw tightly and then gave me a polite neutral answer. (Except the honest guy. He laughed at me with an ""If you bother him enough he raises. But don't except the world"")So I basically made my mind up about looking for a new job. Despite me liking the job itself and coworkers.\_\_\_\_In my private life:My neighbor upstairs had water damage, so my bathroom and kitchen is a mold fest. I've got three different types of mold, which is a certain kind of achievement I guess.Luckily my buddy offered me his flat for cheap, since he left the country for a job opportunity.&#x200B;So mold, finding a new job, moving into a new flat, being only at home on the weekends, helping the girlfriend with her new flat.It's all a bit much. And I currently get stressed very easily. Girlfriend wants something and I'm innerly tightening up.I kinda don't wanna feel this way. Especially since I know I can handle all of this.Only today I thought about taking care of my mental health in all of this and looking to get atop on this.Since overwhelmed is something I deal with yearly (:D) it seems like a good idea to get a handle on my emotions.&#x200B;Any suggestions?So far I've noticed that I think about changing the job in an unideal way. Lots of questions I keep repeating internally to which I don't have the answers (yet).Today I tried to switch to thinking about what new job-conditions I actually want and felt better.The biggest drag is not knowing about specific job offers yet. I got 5 offers from friends in the industry already and my old boss is even bothering my friend ""Whats u/shibiku doing? Ask him. I would hire him on the spot!""But I'd rather searched thoroughly this time. Accepting the first offer (which I did with the current offer ... which was okay, but they obscured all of the stuff I'm now unhappy with during the interview. Despite me directly asking about it ...) didn't do me good.",POS

Later on because of the fragmentation of NLP into different camps in 80s and 90s, lead to fragmentation of knowledge as well, and as such a number of courses came by, different models were brought into these courses, and unfortunately there was no central body to manage what was going on, hence, the quality of courses dropped. Trainers with half baked information started to train in NLP with their own map,  and that created a lot of issues that we see in NLP during present times. NLP based coaching is probably a subset of classic NLP Practitioner and Master Practitioner programs. While the coaching fraternity development and emerged alongside NLP, but coaching community eventually was limited to a few accreditation bodies, ICF and EMCC being the most prominent ones. A lot of NLP coaches have aligned with ICF, because ICF keeps a check on what is being offered, and under the ethics, standards and guidelines of coaching umbrella. Now if you are looking for an NLP course, but with more of Coaching flavor. Look for a coaching course delivered by an NLP Trainer who has learnt NLP from Richard Bandler, John Grinder, Robert Dilts, Judith, Steve, Michael Hall, Steve Gilligan, Joseph OC, and other known NLP trainers, and have specifically attended a coaching courses from Master Coach Trainers associated with different accreditation bodies like ICF, EMCC, or Meta Coaching. If you are looking to specifically looking to use NLP knowledge in Life Coaching[How to become a Life Coach](https://nlpcoach.in/how-to-become-a-life-coach-in-india/), Leadership Coaching, Wellness Coaching, then this approach of learning from someone who knows both NLP, and has good understanding of coaching helps.

I wanted to share this post as a way of making contact with other NLP students around the world so we can share information and grow together.&#x200B;Here in Brazil, we have many NLP schools that teach distorted information. It´s very rare to find people that can stick to the original NLP models or at least add more quality to them without taking any information away (when teaching). As a result, we have a very poor NLP community.  I have the opportunity to learn from Dr. Nelson Spritzer, PhD, here in my hometown Porto Alegre (@drnelsonspritzer on IG). He learned NLP and then trained with Richard Bandler's supervision for some weeks, so his model is splendid. Besides that, he was a Cardiology researcher for many years, so he is absolutely careful with the information he shares and has very good criteria to make his choices. He really is an example of what he´s teaching: a model of wisdom, health and good choicemaking. &#x200B;I believe NLP can really impact the humanity in a good way. If people knew more about the way their unconscious mind works and the techniques to control it, we would really see our race have better results in many spheres: individually, colectively, with earth,... and others.

Our need to actualize our potential, our need to become the best version of ourselves, to express ourselves fully, our need to continually improve....  These needs are just as real as our need for food and water --- they just operates in a different way.As a coach, leader and/or someone interested in developing your potential this is an important distinction to understand.The most famous model of self-actualization is Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs model where at the bottom of the pyramid are our survival needs, above that is security, and then social, self-esteem and at the top of the pyramid are these higher 'self-actualization' needs.As human beings we start at the bottom of the pyramid at our survival needs and as we gratify those sufficiently we are freed to move up to the next level.An example that I use to describe this is to imagine that you are under water holding your breath.In the beginning it is likely that you can really enjoy being under water. You can relax, think about your goals, reflect on your life, and just enjoy yourself.As time goes on however, as your lower need for oxygen remains ungratified, more and more of your attention gets pulled toward gratifying that need.Eventually it can reach the point where someone could lose their sense of self, lose their values, and might even consciously or unconsciously drown another individual just to get some air because every single cell in one's body becomes devoted toward that one task — meeting that lower need. One of the amazing things about our lower needs is that the second that you get a deep breath of oxygen, air is the last thing on your mind. Almost immediately you are freed up to focus on other things in your life.The lower needs work in this way. They unlock level upon level as you sufficiently gratify the level below: The less you have, the more you need them. The second you fulfill them, they completely drop out of consciousness.This is not the same as how our self-actualization needs work. Perhaps surprisingly they work in quite the opposite way.  The more you get them the more you want them!The more the painter paints, the more they want to paint.The more the singer sings, the more they want to sing.The more you express yourself fully the more you want to express yourself fully.But there is a problem with this...We are not able to visit in this 'higher' realm, let alone live there, until our lower needs are sufficiently gratified.Every morning we wake up and we need to eat again. Every night we need to sleep again. Every month we need to pay our bills.If you try to live at the peak without meeting your lower needs you will eventually burn out or need to divert your path. It is just not sustainable.It is only when we have systems in place to consistently gratify our lower needs that we are able to free up our inner vitality to really focus on what it is that we are best at - what it is we are meant to do in this world.Let's take a moment of self-reflection:* How well are you meeting your lower needs on a consistent basis? Perhaps your focus could be on implementing strategies to meet these lower needs in a systematic way.* Where would you say that you are currently living in terms of Maslow's pyramid? Are you more focused on survival, security, social, or at the top of the pyramid?   This self-assessment will give you a system for knowing what to prioritize for the next stage of your development.* At what level are you focusing your vitality at this stage of development and is that aligned with your needs? For example if you are really focused on getting a relationship, but are unable to pay your bills you may want to reconsider your priorities.In better understanding how our needs work we can gain perspective as to what our sticking points are and we can realign our priorities at each stage of our development to make ongoing progress towards unleashing our highest and best potential as a human being.",POS

So the fairy of inspiration can descent from the heavens ... nothing.**What does work** ... at least the only solution ""to get back into the game"" I have found was to start where I am.Starting up journaling or written excercises, I screw up the first page. Just writing it without coherent thought out plan or prettiness to it. Messy, unsorted and somewhat uncomfortable. Exactly how I feel towards the subject actually. Then out of that ... a more refined version emerges.Same with fitness.

Here are 6 Neuro-Semantic models that will greatly expand your capabilities as a NLP Practitioner and Coach.Model #1: The Meta-States Model - For Unconscious CommunicationBeyond the traditional communication model of NLP the Meta-States model opens us to much more accurately track and transform the higher levels of mind, belief systems, inner dialogue, and all of the meta levels of the mind in a systemic and organized manner.Acknowledged by INLPTA in 1995 as “the most significant contribution to NLP”, Meta-States model give us the ability to track back from someone’s behavior and representations up to the layers and layers of thoughts in the back of the mind that govern that experience all the way back down to our resulting behavior.Model #2: The Axes of Change Model - For Change & LearningThe Axis of Change incorporates the four key mechanisms for generative change – Motivation, Decision, Creation and Solidification. Not only does it create a structured framework for coaching conversations, but it will make your blind spots as a practitioner blatantly obvious and give you a clear path to expand your personal growth, coaching, and communication skills.Designed for generative change, the Axes of Change Model results in change that is sustainable without the resistance and relapse features that characterize many other models designed for more remedial change.This model dramatically transformed the way that I do coaching and is a powerful change model that I use in my sales process as well as to enhance all of my other NLP techniques.Model #3: The Benchmarking Model – For Measurement & ImplementationBy its nature subjective experience is... subjective!Would you like to learn a model that you can use to make intangible experiences more objective and measurable?At its core the Neuro-Semantic Benchmarking model is based upon the ability to use the Meta-Model and to de-nominalize terms back down to their sensory based referents – but it takes this process so much farther.In fact, this art has been refined over and over again in each competency based Meta-Coach Certification Training.The practice of Neuro-Semantic benchmarking has massively transformed my ability to stretch my global-detail & intuitor-sensor meta-programs with truly life changing consequences.Applying this model allows us to take our outcomes, values, skills and experiences and make them measurable so we can better track the growth, learning and development of ourselves and those whom we work with.Model #4:  The Self-Actualization Quadrants - For Self-ActualizationIf you know me at all you know that in my opinion — Self-Actualization is the highest frame within which to practice NLP, Coaching, and Neuro-Semantics.  Self-Actualization is the larger frame from in which we can check the ecology of any system or change, and when we focus on unleashing the highest and best of ourselves and our clients everything else falls into place.Model #5: The Matrix Model – For Systemic ThinkingThe Matrix Model is designed as a systems model for thinking and working systemically with people, groups and organizations.  In Neuro-Semantics we use the Matrix Model for working with the multiple layers of meaning frames that create and describe the client’s world so that we can “follow the energy through the system”.Starting with any external event, the matrix model allows us to track the process of embodying that information, processing that information, metabolizing that information into energy and embodying it into the state from which our behaviors flow out of.We use the Matrix Model and its 7 matrices as a template for gathering and sorting information, for profiling, modeling, and working with the systemic complexity of human experience.Model #6: The Facilitation Model – For Facilitating ChangeWhen you coach/communicate with others (or yourself) do you tend to be too soft, empathetic and supportive?Or perhaps you fall on the other side of the spectrum overly pushing and challenging in your communications.The Neuro-Semantic Facilitation Model organizes the 7 core skills of Coaching/Communication onto the Meaning and Performance Axes so we can stretch ourselves as facilitators and take ourselves to the next level as agents of change.Not only that, but it ‘facilitates’ you to find your perfect balance between being ruthlessly challenging and compassionately supportive.When I first discovered this model I (like many other coaches) tended to be overly supportive in my coaching to the detriment of my clients.  Now I have the permission, capability, and experience of challenging my clients to take action and to stretch which has had dramatic effects in their (as well as my own) performance.Any questions?

It supports me in building more genuinely caring relationships.  It supports me in generating long term, sustainable, win-win relationships personally and professionally. This reframe supports me in more healthy and respectful communication patterns and it supports me in treating others as I would like to be treated.In terms of coaching relationships this way of operating supports me in building collaborative relationships with my clients in service of them and their desired outcomes. It supports my clients to feel more empowered to take responsibility for their own results, increases their personal power, and it demonstrates as a role model a much more resourceful way of how to relate with other people.With over ten years having passed since I shifted this way of thinking for myself I can say from my personal experience that doing NLP 'with people' has been much more powerful for me than doing NLP 'on people'.",POS

Perhaps you have been coaching for some time now but still aren’t as confident in your skills as you would like to be, even though you are excited to share your tools with the world?Recently I received a question from a client asking how I built my practice, and how I was able to build trust in myself and my skills.Below is the first part of my reply...To begin, I practiced at every opportunity I could. There are some skills where I needed to have someone’s permission and make it more formal of a coaching session, but there were also skills that could be practiced more informally and conversationally. For example, whenever I would be buying something I would practice basic rapport, listening, questioning with the person at the register. I would practice shifting the state of somebody sitting next to me on the bus, at the crosswalk or at the cafe. Any opportunity I got I would practice for free.I asked anyone and everyone if I could practice X technique with them or do Y process to help them achieve an outcome.  A basic script of what I would ask people was something along the lines of:“Hi! I have been training as a coach and was wondering if you would be open to experiencing a 25 minute session with me. Worst case scenario things are exactly the same but we could potentially help you make a big impact in your life that otherwise wouldn’t have happened.  Would you be open to this?”Or “Hey, I learned a process that could help you achieve X. Would you be open to experiencing this with me? It only takes 15-20 minutes. Worst case scenario you end up exactly the same but many people share that this has had a profound impact for them.  Would you be open to experience this with me?”I found that having a time frame was important because you don’t want it to go on forever.  Whether it is 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour, I would invite people to experience free sessions with me and at the end I would ask them for their feedback.* What did I do that you loved in that session?* What was the best skill I demonstrated?* What could I have said, done, or asked that would have taken your experience to the next level?In fact, after 10 years of experience as a coach I still ask these questions after many of my sessions.  Honest feedback is one of the best ways to increase your competence. And if they share that they enjoyed the session, you can always ask for a testimonial and/or referral. If you sense that they got a lot of value you can also invite them to work with you more formally.

His name is Dr. H. Norman Wright. I'm wondering if anyone has any information on his studying NLP. His model of the brain, advice on building rapport, and even some techniques he shows on reducing stress, seem like they're based on NLP (one of his techniques I recognized as hypnosis), and he recommends hypnotic training like EMDR.Third question...

Did they come by choice? Were they forced to work with you? Did they come to you tentatively or with desire? Did they invest money to have this meeting? All of these factors will help determine the level of ‘rapport’ right out of the gate. The more desiring, willing, and invested they are as a general rule the more open they will be to share more deeply.DEVELOPING YOUR SKILLS OF LISTENING AND SUPPORTING Most people are not aware of their ‘real’ problems’ or ‘real goals’ — or at least they aren’t very clear on how to communicate them. So they will test you with smaller problems/pseudo problems and see how you respond before bringing the ‘real’/’deeper’ issues to the table. How do you handle these?Do you default quickly to giving advice? Or do you actively & non-judgmentally listen, ask exploratory questions, acknowledge what you are hearing, check that you are understanding correctly, summarize what you have heard, etc. Do you separate out pseudo problems & symptoms from the real issues and hear what isn’t being stated directly?Do you call them out when you calibrate that they are being inauthentic, shallow, or playing it safe and invite them to get real? These skills will allow them to feel safe, supported, understood and build trust in your competence & caring so they will be more comfortable to share their deeper, more meaningful issues.DEVELOPING YOUR DEEP QUESTIONING SKILLS Ask deeper questions that pull them one level deeper than they have shared and see if you have resistance or if they follow your lead. In many contexts it is our job as a ‘coach’ to invite the deeper sharing rather than to ‘wait for it’.DEVELOPING YOUR SKILL OF FRAMING Setting frames up front can help accelerate this process. Let them know that your conversations are confidential (because most of your clients refer their friends and colleagues to you or whatever reason is authentic to you). Let them know up front that you’re going to ask them deeper questions to get to the heart of what is most important. Let them know up front that the more real they are, the more real/authentic their results will be, etc.What frames can you set at the beginning of your sessions/meetings that will allow them to feel more comfortable/help resolve some resistance they may be feeling to authentically share?DEVELOPING YOUR COACHING STATE Lastly for now, how well do you unconditionally accept your clients? How well can you appreciate them as people and even appreciate their ‘problems’/parts of themselves that even they don’t appreciate about themselves yet? How much can you see them as a unique and sacred individual on a growth journey? How much do you put yourself aside and so they can sense it is all about them rather than about you, your ego, or you getting results. And again, how well can you ‘just listen’ and explore without the need to change anything. All of these things will support them in feeling safe and supported and accelerate the process of opening up. (All of these states can be cultivated more deeply in yourself with the tools in our State Elicitation course).All of these skills and states will support you in your coaching to create the safe space your clients need to open up and discover the real and significant issues in their life that will create meaningful change to make your work so valuable they can’t help but actively promote and praise you and your work.",POS

Despite my best efforts I have had a hard time making changes stick.  Frankly, I have reverted on 99% of the change work I have done.  The only thing I have made stick was silly.  I renewed my taste for an album that I played out more than twenty years ago by mapping it across to something new and exciting.  (Pretty Hate Machine by Nine Inch Nails for those who are curious.)  As a result I finally got around to playing with something that my trainer called tasking.      I haven't seen this discussed anywhere so I'm posting it here in hopes that I  can help someone to help themselves.  It was taught to me that getting the client where they want to be while in the session is on the practitioner but once the client is back out in the world the responsibility for staying there is on them.  This is where tasking comes in.  Tasking is assigning the client (of in this case, yourself) homework designed to keep them in the effective mindset that was created during the session.  In my personal case, I have a list of statements of intent on my closet door that I read multiple times per day with the intent of taking the meaning of the statement into my current state.  It's kind of like an affirmation however it works better than affirmations alone.  In this case, I have created a change with NLP and am using the statement of intent to reaffirm the change that I made rather than trying to convince myself of something by repetition alone.     The second thing that I want to stress is for those who lean more toward the kinesthetic end of things.  When I talk about the statements on my closet door I mean that I write them in a way that I will feel when I read them.  Then, As I read the statements of intent I take a second to really dwell in how the intent of the statement feels.  Over a short time you will be better able to sustain the feeling for longer and longer.     Third, even though it is taught that when mapping across, you map across the visual submodalities don't be afraid to try mapping across auditory and kinesthetic also.  Mapping across kinesthetic submodalities is how I got myself to enjoy Pretty Hate Machine again.",POS

So I have built many behaviors around this.\_\_\_\_\_\_Structuring the inner world towards ""Nobody likes me"" - while searching for proof in the real world to justify that belief - is described in the aforementioned video.Which is easy to do, since lots of social interactions can have something that can be misinterpreted and dwelled upon. Very easy to have resistance towards something and then gnaw on that one remark - that sounded like something your dad said to you when you were little - for the rest of the evening.\_\_\_\_\_\_Restructuring said world towards something more healthy like ""Some people like me, some love me and a few find me attractive"" is a very doable endeavor and affirmation that triggers happiness in me. (Worked a lot on this, so I can swallow it somewhat without resistance. Tweaking the audio-submodalities towards a believable, pleasant voice was good here)\_\_\_\_\_\_The questions would be:To which degree should we built our inner world of thoughts towards something that pleases us vs. changing the reality for real?What would be the best way of changing our inner world towards the better?Is one ever satisfied with their social interactions and feels constantly like ""they belong"" and ""are loved"" or is one never to be satisfied no matter how much external validation is given?&#x200B;&#x200B;\_\_\_\_\_\_ &#x200B;Meta-Commentary    After this the post becomes more of a rant. The top part is the structured questions and talking topics I wanted to share.&#x200B;&#x200B;My story here:Thinking of loneliness as motivating social pain. Without it I wouldn't think much about widening or maintaining my social circle, since for me it's sometimes more work than fun. While I'm socially able and people want to hang out with me, it seldom gives me much. Which is also the main thing girlfriends have broken up with me over ""emotionally unavailable, like a robot.""Makes sense, my dad has 0 friends - my mom likes the drama of people for entertainment and has a gaggle of girlfriends, but keeps them at arms length. They live for their business and only have each other (and their dog, which they adore). So my internal values are skewed towards the same ideals. Or as my first girlfriend described it ""Your family is the coldest I have ever met. Their not dementors in itself, but their presence sure makes the windows freeze over"" I did get two hugs from my mom.So it's not completely frozen :D&#x200B;&#x200B;Let's say the main hiccup with social interactions that leads to pain is resistance.The breaking of rapport because the other has shown or said something that doesn't sit right with us.Let's say my distant aunt goes on a rant about how ""Covid-Masks are bullshit""I know she throws out this generalization of her beliefs, mainly because she can't just swallow the threat of covid. Covid restrictions destroyed her whole service industry business and she didn't have any income since 12.2019 and probably wont have any income till Summer. She's vicious and the tonality in her statement shows.I would like to break rapport, cause simplifying it to ""Masks are bullshit"" doesn't sit right with me. I would like to get the statement right and bulldoze over her whole statement with ""the truth"" (my truth). But that doesn't get me anywhere in terms of rapport and social joy.Leaving myself behind to go into her rabbit hole of frustration and anger would connect me with her, but I get a feeling of cringe and mini-vomit just thinking about it. Not really worth itWhile I actually haven't talked to that aunt in 2 years. I have this exact problem in almost of all of my social interactions. Nobody fits perfect and my inability to be flexible, go into their world and be interested into going into their world causes me loneliness.I have recognized that this is a problem in my life and are looking for ways to change this. Fiddling around with my inner world of thought and beliefs seems like a good start. Especially since forcing myself towards social groups is an ongoing theme in my life, which I dislike most of the time.The only social situation where I listen like a hawk to what people are saying and are interested is the NLP Groups I managed in my city (Died due to covid :/). Luckily my job will give me enough financial freedom to travel to a bigger city and hopefully get a bigger NLP group going again after Covid subdues (2024 \*fingers crossed\*). So that's my current hope to get a social circle going that I share an interest with.&#x200B;&#x200B;\_\_\_\_\_\_",POS

I'm not looking to guide others to entering a more resourceful state, I really just want to command it within myself, so I can better tackle obstacles of my life.         Keep in mind that, having been in the sales industry for about a decade of my life already, I probably already have a basic background of NLP. I also work with a therapist who has an NLP background and explained some of these things to me, like pattern interrupts.  * Are there any good books for working on this sort of thing?    * Since I'm looking specifically to work on things internally, do I even need to read any longer books? If not, what are some guides, websites, blogs, videos, etc. that can be just as helpful?    * What are some ways where I can work on triggering a resourceful state?",NEG

It’s application for ‘self-development’ that is being targeted towards children, as well as its use to treat medical conditions in children by those with no medical training or education; and alarmingly its encroachment into the school and classroom environments for both.My hope is that this email will start a conversation with those who are best equipped to have it, so that the right action can be taken to ensure the welfare of all children.There are a lot of people in this world selling snake oil, “cure all’s”, one in particular is N.L.P. N.L.P. is part of the self-development industry which is estimated to be worth globally $15 billion with nearly 6% average yearly gains. To put it lightly, people are making serious money from self-development. The selling of books, seminars online programmes, podcasts, blogs, live speaking events, and coaching are some of the mediums used.This is potentially problematic because, put simply, people are more profitable to the self-development industry if they are unhappy and discontent, than they would be if they are happy and fulfilled.In order to successfully market any self-development product, a sense of self dissatisfaction needs to be created in the prospective market or customer. In order to pull them in this is achieved by projecting a feeling of inadequacy. In turn, each piece of self-development material consumed, be it a video, book, seminar, webinar, or 1 on 1 session with a life coach, will give the consumer a sense of wellbeing, a small high. This high is caused by a surge in dopamine levels that rise in the brain.This is incredibly dangerous because it can create an addictive cycle of behaviour. Self-development will make you feel good. There's no doubt about it. There's a feeling of satisfaction that anyone will have after finishing a self-development book, or after attending a seminar or coaching session, because these products are designed to give you a sense of motivation and accomplishment, especially in a group context where group social biases can make people vulnerable to the perceived inadequacies and insecurities upon which they are marketed to resolve. But that feeling of accomplishing something isn’t real because you haven’t actually accomplished anything other than consume a product that is designed to make you feel as though you have. Furthermore, that feeling of motivation, that bubble may burst due to external forces outside a person’s control, leading them to feel personally responsible for not having the success that was marketed to them, because they didn’t put in ‘enough hard work and commitment’ that you were told they needed to put in while their brain was flooded with dopamine. (Imagine this if you are suffering from depression, I’ll come to that later) Due to an increased sense of inadequacy this leaves people needing more and so the cycle of the consumption of more self-development material begins again.The reason anything becomes addictive is not because of the thing itself. The reason someone becomes addicted to cocaine is not cocaine; it's what the cocaine does to the brain. It’s the rush of dopamine caused by cocaine that gets a user hooked. It’s the rush of dopamine that causes addiction. N.L.P. and other self-development products can cause pathological behaviour cycles by creating a dependency on the feeling of wellbeing triggered by dopamine. It does so by using social context and behaviour to turn people into a consumer of its products by playing inadequacy against success to create a false sense accomplishment and motivation that facilitates a dopamine rush, the high. N.L.P and other forms of self-development stimulate the same neurological and psychological mechanisms as cocaine.In order to become an N.L.P. life coach or self-development guru I would suggest that you would have fallen foul to this kind of predatory marketing and in turn, in some way become addicted to its products and ideas. There are many N.L.P. organisations. I will focus solely on the ones I have seen that are aimed towards children that I believe to be toxic.Many N.L.P. organisations and self-development gurus market the idea to potential prospective N.L.P. practitioners of being your own boss (are you sick of the 9 to 5?), financial freedom (do you want less stress?), success (do you need people to think highly of you?), all whilst helping children. You can do this after attending a course lasting only 4 days. Some even with one of those days spent on teaching someone how to set up a children’s therapy practice, and how to market their particular brand of N.L.P. as a franchise. Shockingly but not unsurprisingly there are optional add-ons, so after attending and successfully passing your short course, you can pass on your new N.L.P. skills to parents, and teachers.Some of these N.L.P. and self-development practitioners take the opportunity to present themselves as a guru with promotional video testimonials from their ‘licenced practitioners’ praising them for their support and helping them achieve success, and finish as all new wave internet gurus do with “make the commitment”, “hard work”, “earn money” and “success”, with the offering of monthly private webinars and closed forums of N.L.P. and self-development content and not failing to subtly mention the financial commitment to your new guru to ensure your skills are up to date so you can acquire your next annual franchise licence for your successful N.L.P. business in what, on the face of it, appears in some instances to be a pyramid scheme.Some of these N.L.P. and self-development organisations seem to blur the distinction between a medical licence and a franchise licence and sell the idea of helping children with medical conditions to potential practitioners who may then go on to think that because they are a ‘licenced N.L.P. practitioner’ and may already be a registered child minder, and have a clean police check; they can treat the symptoms of a number of medical conditions that could have their roots in all kinds of serious conditions that these practitioners would lack the competencies to diagnose.One video testimonial I have seen, the new practitioner states they felt dissatisfied with the corporate world, so signed up to become a child therapist, and so applied to attend and after a 4 day course was a child therapist. In short you can quit your job at McDonald’s on Monday and by Friday be under the illusion that you are a ‘fully registered and licenced’ child therapist.I struggle to reconcile the notion that it is possible to become a professional child therapist, regardless of whether or not you then operate in schools, but especially if you do, after completing a course lasting less than a week. I further struggle to believe that you can tell people that you are a licenced child therapist after completing one of these courses. I struggle more to believe that people who don’t have a degree in psychology or any medical qualification who are not doctors or professors are allowed to teach people to become a child therapist and give them the illusion that can work with children and in schools. It is my belief that this appears to actually be happening.Schools, while having checks in place may fall short, because their child mentors and class support workers have a clean police check and are registered child minders and when they say they are a ‘licenced practitioner’, do schools realise this isn’t from a recognised medical training scheme and in actual fact issued by someone selling ’self-development’ franchises on the internet in an unregulated industry that the scientific community has dismissed due to its numerous factual errors and its lack of empirical evidence for effectiveness and recognises as pseudoscience. When it comes to diagnosing medical conditions, a medically trained professional, a Doctor, will, after many years of study, approach any patient with a degree of scepticism, and after rigorous investigation and the process of elimination rule out what things are definitely not, in order to find out what things may be, before narrowing down a diagnosis and then deciding on the correct course of treatment for a given condition. N.L.P. practitioners after a 3 or 4 day course won’t be able to do this, and would, with an unscientific mind, approach a patient with any given condition with flow chart diagnostics. They will look for certain symptoms that they could potentially treat with N.L.P. Once confirmation bias has falsely validated a condition, they would then apply their N.L.P. techniques to treat what they believe can be treated with N.L.P. Should they have accurately diagnosed a condition, blind luck will be interpreted as success.Anxiety, O.C.D., A.D.H.D., Anger, Depression, , could all have social triggers, but are also symptomatic of other very serious conditions that N.L.P. practitioners would not be able to recognise with flow chart diagnostics let alone effectively diagnose or realise they should even be aware of after attending a 4 day seminar. As such, this could cause significant problems further down the line for a child with autoimmune disease, or perhaps a genetic condition like hemochromatosis, McLeod Neuroacanthocytosis Syndrome, Cushing's Syndrome (the list can go on) or in the worst case some types of Cancer. The symptoms of conditions these practitioners are treating could also be early onset schizophrenia. Schizophrenia causes all sorts of social and psychological symptoms because it is fundamentally a language disorder that in part robs the patient of the capacity to distinguish between their internal thoughts and the real world through something called ‘concrete language’. If you apply some one size fits all thinking techniques to a person (a child in this instance) suffering from this form of psychosis, the damage that could be done is catastrophic and potentially puts people, (children), in serious danger.As a more frightening example, Depression (in its truest most destructive sense) is a genetic neurochemical disorder, that is as biological as diabetes, which through the impact of life experience influences, or perhaps just any way robs people at a biological level of the ability to experience joy. (Consider here what I mentioned above - that sense of personal responsibility for failure) Combine all this with people’s inability to distinguish the difference between being depressed and having depression due to semantic similarities and the social stigmatisms that further impact the psyche of someone who is already withdrawn and you have a cocktail for disaster. You can’t just sit them down and go through some thinking or social behavioural techniques and expect it to improve. This is because Depression, a neurochemical disorder, is in most cases a serotonin deficiency. This is analogous to sitting a diabetic down and telling them to snap out of it and hoping that in so doing their pancreas starts producing insulin. Depression is treated with professional therapy in conjunction with prescribed S.S.R.I. medication to trigger the production of serotonin in the brain. N.L.P. and other self-development products release dopamine. Neurochemically speaking this is comparable to treating depression with a cocaine habit. Children will report that they will feel better. Neither these practitioners, children, nor parents would be aware that they are actually not better and have in actual fact substituted a lack of self-worth, with a short term high, just like a ‘fix’. The damage that could be done here could result in suicide. This is because a patient with depression is at their most vulnerable from suicide when they are going through what appears to be a recovery; when everyone around them thinks they are doing well; after a period of psychomotor retardation, as they now have energy to take action on their self-destructiveness and self-harming thoughts.I would suggest, the positive results that these organisations are reporting for treating Depression (as well as a number of other conditions) are in actual fact the result of a fallacy of composition biased by false validation because N.L.P. makes people ‘feel good’. In some cases children, sick children, who are potentially becoming hooked on the dopamine rush from consuming self-development products from an unregulated industry that has found its way into the classroom. I would further suggest that these statistics are in actual fact an alarm bell that should be seen as the number of children, potentially sick children, who are becoming self-development product addicts.While the above may be extreme worst case scenarios, of which there could be more. Where more unnoticed damage could be done is in the realm of personality disorders and pathological behaviour.Brain chemistry plays a huge role in personality disorders. ‘Messenger chemicals’ such as the previously mentioned serotonin are used in the brain to transmit signals between brain cells. Altered levels of serotonin have been linked to depression, aggression and difficulty controlling destructive urges. All of which some N.L.P. organisations wrongly target with their N.L.P. therapy which triggers dopamine.In addition to this, if a person is overly sensitive to negative emotions and is neurotic, N.L.P. practitioners conditioning a child to avoid circumstances that may trigger negative feelings or reconditioning their thinking about these circumstances with repetitive self-affirmations reinforced with dopamine, could lead the child to develop a pathological narcissistic personality disorder simply because practitioner, parent, teacher or child wouldn’t be able to determine the difference between an angry child feeling better due to dopamine, and creating pathological behaviour models that will become malignant over time.Are parents made fully aware that their child’s mentor, classroom assistant or even therapist; are offering or passively using potentially addictive pseudoscience from an unregulated industry for personal development? Furthermore do they realise in some cases offering this as a treatment for what they don’t realise is more often than not symptoms of autoimmune diseases or genetic disorder that require proper medical treatment? While these practitioners may have passed a police background check, and who are ‘fully licenced’, do the parents realise that these practitioners in actual fact have no medical training or education? Do parents realise they in fact only have a franchise licence from an unregulated industry issued after a 4 day course by a person; who in one instance that I have seen, who also has no formal medical training or education and holds only a certification in nursery nursing?N.L.P. used by a psychiatrist with an advanced degree and understanding of psychology I am sure presents no problem what so ever. In fact there are numerous success stories about it positively changing people’s lives all of which are highly commendable but in these instances N.L.P. was applied by a trained any qualified psychotherapist.N.L.P. in the wrong hands, like someone with no medical background having completed only a 3 or 4 day course is in my opinion reckless and incredibly dangerous. It is then being used to treat children’s medical conditions by people who are not qualified to know what they are doing. As well as being used in the application of self-development by exposing children to a potentially addictive cycle of consumption, that in the short term may make a child feel good, but in the long term may have catastrophic consequences.The self-development industry could be seen as a community of individuals and entrepreneurs looking to better themselves. These life coaches could be seen as providing value by trying to make people’s lives better. I am sure some of them are. So where’s the harm? This is naive thinking when you're dealing with an unregulated industry that is worth billions that relies upon creating a sense of vulnerability and inadequacy to snare its practitioners that can then potentially be projected onto others to make a profit on potentially addictive products especially when they are marketed to children with medical conditions. In seems to me to be a pyramid scheme glued together by projecting social inadequacy onto the next person, so they can return a sense of affirmation.It is my belief that there are people in The U.K. and quite likely elsewhere probably globally who have no medical qualifications, using potentially addictive N.L.P. techniques on children in schools. They have no education in psychology, they are not psychiatrists, and some have no medical qualifications. Some have only done a course only a few days long. Some of these people are treating psychological problems in children in schools.I want to be clear, I am making no accusation of abuse against any individual, or organisation. There is no conspiracy, there is no malice. It is only my opinion that this is something that could potentially be harmful to children being committed naively by those who probably have the best of intentions, who are ignorant in their actions. This in my opinion has been allowed to take place due to an institutional failure that has let the potentially toxic side of an unregulated industry slip through the net and find its way into the classroom.Please approach this with due diligence and care, children are involved, practitioners may have children, who could be exposed to backlash from sensationalist reactions. The self-development industry is unregulated, and that needs to change. Step one, get it out of the classroom.  Should N.L.P. be regulated?[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j9t5az)",NEG

The utter nonsense that is spread in the personal development field, that we create our own destiny is more hurtful for people like Scarlett than it is for others. Yet like everything, utter nonsense might trigger negative emotions in us, like the guilt of not doing enough which leads us to do something and look for answers. That’s what happened with Scarlett.After being mentally, emotionally, physically, sexually, and spiritually abused by people as close as the first-degree family, and as far as a taxi driver she met for the first time, or maybe by life just being mean because that is life sometimes, shit just plain happens. You can call it bad luck, and you can add to that the lack of opportunity to access a good support system that helps her create boundaries to protect herself.We met for a couple of sessions, and her main answers to most of my questions were the following two answers:· “I don’t know “· “I am not able to”So, I looked at her and asked the ever-annoying question: “ what's stopping you from knowing and doing whatever the hell you want to do?”“Well, most of those who traumatized me are either dead, abroad, and in jail. Those who I still have access to trigger me so much I cannot even talk to them. And I have so much to say…”“Alright then, you got to say them, Scarlett.”""But how?""“Well, you open Microsoft word, write a letter to each one of them. Then you open your email and send them to attached me. After you do that you delete the mail from your sent and trash folder. I read them and analyze them to know what we need to work on for you to start feeling better. When we start getting results, I will resend them to you so that you can read them from another perspective”“But…. I can’t…”""Why?""“I harbor so many negative emotions, I might say a lot of mean and destructive things.”“You do realize that you and I are the only ones that will read them, right?”“That’s what I am worried about, you changing your mind and not helping me because of what I might say.”“Yes, my feelings will be hurt when you express yours towards strangers, I never met that hurt you in ways beyond imagination.”She cracked a smirk, and said: “Ok, I will try…. How much time do I have?”“Can you send them tonight?” I said in a serious tone“No way, I can’t, I need at least 10 days, I don’t know what to say, this is the hardest thing anyone ever asked of me…”Interruptingly “10 days it is, to the hour, I have set a reminder to keep you committed to the second.”She paid the coaching fee and left. She texted me a lot of questions and objections during the next few days, I did not respond. ( I later discovered from Andrew T. Austin’s work on the patterns of Chronicity, that this correlates to the first pattern that he calls “The 3 stage Ab-reaction”, and the best way to respond to a client’s negative emotion is not to allow them to bend your will with and stay on track you had in mind.)One minute after the deadline, I receive the email from Scarlett with 15 attachments.Without opening any of them, I delete the email from my inbox and trash, because that’s between Scarlett and them, and is of no business to me. From the following session, we started to get some improvement and result as she stopped carrying the unwanted weight of all the unsaid conversations to these 15 people.Oh — I told her that I deleted the emails a year down the line, and she said laughingly “You asshole, but I wanted to see my drama, I was so looking forward to it, but I guess what’s in the past is in the past…”NB: The stories I am sharing here are not prescriptions or advice in any way, they are just stories of what worked and did not work for me in specific contexts with specific people.",NEG

It really isn’t.”She laughs, looks at me confused, and said you know this might be the connection, and then proceeded to tell a story where she heard missiles on a specific day that left a specific impact on her.Two days later, I get a video on WhatsApp from Janet of her in the kitchen next to a pressure pot smiling.What I said could have been what really was the connection, or simply it was just a counterexample to what the fear meant to her up to that moment.

The school psychiatrist suggested to his mom that Peter starts on anti-psychotic medication. For any mom, hearing that was unacceptable and wanted to find other answers, so the psychiatrist gave the mom two months to find an answer to Peter’s problem or he will have to change schools because his reactions are influencing his classmates negatively.Peter’s problem was that he was hallucinating a nun, visually and auditorily, VALAK from the movie The Conjuring, that caused him to have Panic Attacks, scream, and freeze. This had been going for 2 years on a daily basis, since his parents started the process of divorce. &#x200B;[Valak from the Conjuring or as Peter said from the Greek Bible as he never saw the movie.](https://preview.redd.it/znvn3qfstuc51.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=527cae99095e9506591531cab76eec170803d49d)Peter’s mom, lets call her Julia had a friend who knew me, who knows I had the knack with experimenting with challenging cases. Although I am not a therapist, as a Coach and NLP Trainer, I have worked with challenging cases in collaboration with therapists for the better part of the last seven years, and got some interesting results as my frame of mind was different than theirs. Discovery Session, Peter and Julia come together. He shares his story and how long it had been happening. I deliberately misunderstood the name of the nun, and called her the name of a cheese “Kashkaval”, this is a PCW (Provocative Change Works) stance that helps in lightening up the mood and helping the client get out of his state a bit.We did 4 sessions with intervals of between 2 weeks to 4 months in between and here is a summary.Session One: We worked on changing the connection of the emotion to certain images in his mind. Result: He started seeing the Nun once every 2 days instead of dailySession Two: Using the fast phobia model – we worked on changing a specific scene in his mind that started with the moment he started getting scared, and ended at the peak, towards starting way before the fear started where he was safe, and until he reached safety again after the peak.Result: He started seeing the nun once every two weeks, but still believed it was out there not a figment of his imagination. Session Three: Mostly was a provocative conversation, getting him to think of different things in different ways. Two main points played a role here. His biggest trigger was when he was studying Maths and reached a point where he could not understand anymore. He was afraid to fail. So, we did a how to study Maths session a week later that was not related to change work, just a mental strategy session on how to solve problems. The second point was a question I asked “Have you ever taken a picture of “Crispy”?” The nun’s new name because her skin reminded him of crispy chicken. His answer was no.Result: Two weeks later Peter sends me 3 Whatsapp Pictures telling me, that’s her, can you see, can you see? I asked where? Can you mark her for me so I can see her too? And the more he tried, the more it disappeared. And I did not hear from Peter or Julia for a while.Session Four: Three months down the line, Julia calls me and says that Peter really wants to see you. We agreed on a date. Peter had grown in length, lost weight, and had asked his mom to change schools as he was not comfortable in the environment any more. When I asked about “Crispy”, his reply was: “Well I only saw her once, I was camping with my friends, and she showed up in the forest far away, waving her hand as if she was saying goodbye…”That’s when I said goodbye to Peter, knowing that the best way to help someone change something is listening to how they create and maintain the problem, as PCW creator Nick Kemp says, and when heard well, change happens much quicker than expected and in much simpler more straightforward ways.",POS

Body language: mirroring and matching. Assuming I'm standing, they're standing, and I have time to adjust my own posture as they input information into the credit card reader or sign, to what degree should I match (general upper body focus with limbs or very specific like, their ring finger is against counter so I match that)? when is it appropriate to match vs mirror? certain length of time to pause before matching etc?)2. What are some examples of less obvious VAKOG expressions that I can notice and respond to in a complimentary way?3. to what degree can I really practice this with limited time/openness from a customer? Many people will respond to questions and attempts to build rapport with silence or 'yeah'.

And it is even worse if you are mislead by ""bad NLP"" information.* You can miss experience practicing and drilling. Good NLP seminars implement the important factor of modeling and action. The original materials and people who contributed to NLP were constantly meeting up and documenting and sharing their experiences. Those experiences are much different than reading a book and testing out ""anchoring"" a couple days later at work. And it is best to practice after you've watched an expert put it to work.** You won't learn to be dynamic nature of NLP and create unique patterns. There are a few very comprehensive and reputable NLP books like ""The Big Book of NLP"" by Shlomo Vlaknin that give you a good sense of how to apply NLP beyond anchoring, mirroring, and VAK. But NLP is hugely dynamic. And if you only read the basic books or reference random websites, you may not come to realize the full potential you have to implement it.*** You'll miss out on the power NLP can have to affect people. I grew up with applying the scientific method to everything I did and I would say that made me a little too skeptical about most things. Or I would expect to see PhD level scientific research and data before I trusted something ""would work."" You can hear about how NLP can change people from books. But for me, there was nothing like seeing an expert NLP coach working one on one with someone and the effect it can have.**** You only get a taste from reading. Reading is great and there are dozens of valuable books on the subject. Most of them go over the same or similar concepts, but rarely do the books go in depth about how to apply NLP to effectively help people.NLP at its core is a communication and personal development tool. Communication requires people, and personal improvement is more effective when working with experts. Therefore, if you are fortunate enough to have an opportunity... If you want get a very strong understanding of NLP...If you want to apply NLP beyond the basics to communicate better and help others... Practicing with people, with the guidance of an expert will be of huge value to you whether that is through a live training, seminar, or combination of digital and in person.(If you thought this was helpful, check out my newsletter for more ideas and tools: https://mailchi.mp/emmettferguson/mindsetmattersfirstnewsletter)",POS
