DeepSpeech is based off an architecture originally published by Baidu, and then Mozilla created an open source implementation in 2017. The project is no longer officially maintained by Mozilla, but still remains popular and is one of the best libraries for Speech-to-Text in Python. I made a guide on how to do both asynchronous and real time speech recognition with DeepSpeech. Even beginner developers should be able to follow this guide.

This is crucial since it is necessary to understand the language in which the programmes will be executed. Python is one of the best options, but you can also learn other languages like C and C++. It is, however, a matter of personal preference.We'll look at the definition of Python as well as several resources for mastering the language. Python certification is also well-liked by programmers.# Python is a simple language to learnPython is without a doubt the most widely utilised programming language for developing apps in many organisations. Here are a few reasons why Python is an excellent career choice:Python has the most user-friendly syntax and readability of any programming language, making it perfect for both rookie and professional programmers. It's also intuitive and straightforward to understand; in fact, it's almost identical to regular English.**Python supports a wide range of paradigms. On the other hand, the majority of users describe it as a very object-oriented programming language.*** It's a completely open-source and free programming language.* There are hundreds of different systems and libraries from which to pick. Python frameworks simplify the development process.* It saves you time by allowing you to replace the entire solution rapidly.# Let's look at some learning materials for Python programming:**Udemy**This site's initial piece of coursework will be a Python crash course. The topics of syntax and data structures will be discussed. Following the completion of the chapters, you will study data science and machine learning libraries. Just a few examples include Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas.Josh Portilla will be your tutor as well. He also serves as the CEO of Pierian Data Inc., where he oversees data science. In addition to the online programmes, you can contact the teacher for in-person data science and [Python programming](https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/course/python-programming-crash-course/) training. Many personnel from prominent organisations attend his training courses, including Cigna, electric, Suisse, the New York Times, McKinsey, and others.* During the session, you will learn important concepts such as:* The tradeoff between bias and variance in cross-validation.* Processes of natural language* Suggestions for systems**There are a variety of machine learning algorithms to choose from.**2.**Teaching Python with TalkPython**Students study Python through project-based learning in this course. You'll learn the Python syntax as well as how to execute tasks in Python. Furthermore, once you've completed the course, you'll be able to work independently on your Python projects.During the initial study, you will learn how to construct ten applications. The training is affordable, costing only $69 for lifetime access. However, we recommend that you check the material and summary before paying for the course. When you finish the course, see if they offer Python programming certification.3. **Coursera is a platform for online learning**It's been running since April 2012, and Andrew NG, a well-known machine learning instructor, is in charge of it. Coursera has partnered with a number of important universities around the world. These schools also provide online certifications, degrees, and courses.4**. Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Development using IBM Python**Your IBM trainer is Joseph Santarcangelo, a Ph.D. Data Scientist at IBM. This platform brings together a wide range of organisations to exchange their knowledge and skills on the subject. Furthermore, this course is suitable for novices and serves as an introduction to Python. Students with no prior programming expertise can also start with this course and learn how to programme in Python. The course covers Python principles, data structures, data assessment, and other subjects. In addition, you will learn about collections and APIs.Machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, dimension reduction, and clustering will also be covered. Aside from that, this course will teach you about typical models such as Root Mean Squared Error, Train/Test Split, and Random Forests.IBM is concentrating on Python's practical applications. As a result, I urge you to think about how machine learning technologies are changing our environment on a regular basis.5. **Python programming tutorials on Socratica**Socratica is a well-known YouTube channel for being one of the best locations to learn Python programming. They deliver programming lectures in a manner that is as engaging and effective as watching a good Netflix show. Python is well-known for its data science and machine learning capabilities. Python's libraries can be used for both front-end and back-end development. Two of the best programmes for quickly constructing AI systems are Scikit-learn and Tensorflow.6.**Codecademy**One of the most popular places to learn data science, Python, and machine learning in general is Codecademy. This platform will teach you about a range of skill path courses. Despite the fact that most of their specialisations are similar to those offered by Coursera, the latter's curriculum is substantially shorter. Its training materials are designed for persons with no prior experience and are beginner-friendly all the way up to expert level. Users can also access crucial learning tools like Codecademy blogs and other resources.# The following are the offered courses on the platform:* Python 3 is being thoroughly investigated* Data visualisation is done with Python* Data Cleaning Technique in Python* A machine learning model is built using Python# ConclusionThe resources listed above provide some of the best training for both beginners and [python expert](https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/course/python-programming-crash-course/). However, before you spend your money and time on the courses, we encourage that you learn everything you can about them. Also, resist the urge to sign up for many classes at the same time. But, no matter the road you take, be sure you stick with it until the finish. A good platform will enable you to put everything you've learnt in their course into practise. Furthermore, avoid getting caught up in the Python vs. R debate because it will just serve to distract you and waste your time.If you want to learn about upcoming technologies, the Global Tech Council is the place to go.",POS

Even if the machine trusts the CA, Python/Requests throws an error because Python has its own openSSL implementation.So normally the solution to this is to either hard code the path to the cert in code or to set an environmental variable with the same information (more on this on the Requests documentation page).  This gets cumbersome when you have layers of dependencies sitting on top of Requests.So basically it would be great to have a simple library that could at the very least check for a self-signed certificate.

However, I cannot find any way to do either of those things.Does anyone know how to replace difflib's comparison function with a custom comparator and to supply it a custom printing function?

As Python projects have never had to worry about whether their dependency tree is correct or not this has led to some projects finding they get stuck backtracking the dependency tree indefinitely.I had a gut feeling there was a better way and I've been working on it on and off for several months. It tries to find the solution of the dependency tree faster when there is a conflict by focusing on the packages causing those conflicts. I have tested many real world requirements that allows Pip to reduce the resolution time from many hours (or more) down to a few seconds or minutes.The Pip maintainers were very helpful!

However half way through that project I came to realize that Python is really missing Rust's enums, aka Algebraic Data Types (ADT). So one thing led to another and after performing some 3am metaclass f\*\*\*ery I came up with this.[https://gist.github.com/aarondewindt/1cb0af45f05c0da03bfbec6f050f5b58](https://gist.github.com/aarondewindt/1cb0af45f05c0da03bfbec6f050f5b58)It works in runtime, but I'm not sure what mypy will think of it, PyCharm isn't a big fan of it though, but then again, it doesn't like the match/case statements yet either. I might further develop it into a proper project in the near future with mypy support, etc. And last of all I'd like to give a special thanks to Eniac, my cat, who woke me up at 2am triggering tonight's saga.",POS

I also learned that if i commit something to the database i need to build in a wait timer to wait half a second or so before reading out if it worked or not, otherwise python is faster than sql and displays the last information.One of the things that really bugs me a lot is one thing i couldn't find out and basically gave up on it and used an ugly IF ELIF tree. I really hope somebody can help me out here. I have 7 inventory slots in the database and i wanna read them all out and put in a generated item if value in this column is 0 (inventory slot empty). I did find some solutions online but what i wasn't able to overcome syntax and formatting issues (the freedom in python on formatting your code is already killing me). I never got it to work.Well the next project will be basically this. Redoing it from ground up, this time with proper functions. More loot, different values, different calculations, maybe add a very basic crafting task.Also if somebody has a hint or a pointer as to how to best handle inventory i would be very grateful. When i started the project i wanted to do it with .txt files as a proof of concept but just the thought of using normal .txt files makes me feel dirty. Then i thought about .json (i have seen a few of them in my life, so i at least know what i am looking at). Of course i then just used the db i had already created. But i wonder is there a better way to do it? Dumping it all in a list and dump the list every X time or Y actions into the db? Or am i thinking wrong simply because of ignorance?",POS

I find it very easy to use, and as a person who just started to understand OOP in Python. I find Kivy to be really easy to understand.   I would like to see Python become a language that is more widely used in App development. From what I know, most app developers use Javascript framework like Node.js, react native, swift etc to make ios & Android apps. And from what I understand, not many developers use Kivy in their developer jobs or Python for that matter in native app development  If I sound new to python, is because I am. So experienced Python developers may disagree with me.   I would like to hear your thoughts on it. Is it perhaps redundant to even consider Kivy as standard library framework?",POS

Less significant (as in, doesn't cause any errors) is the vast array of `if` statements to handle each button. Is there some more elegant way to somehow make like, one function that can take a dict of all of the inputs then produce the appropriate output for that item? I feel like I ought to be able to run an iterator to dump the 'a-z' into the correct part of the function that way I only need 1 definition instead of 32. The real problem I wasn't able to solve though is an error with the user-input side. The `tkinter.Entry` box is intended to be used as both an input and an output - if the user clicks the buttons the box will display the appropriate hex code for that combination, but they also need to be able to input a hex code and see which buttons need to be pressed to produce it. Anything other than an appropriate input throws an error (expected) and the program keeps operating with no concern, but I'd like to sanitize my inputs a bit better. Also I'm not quite following the code flow here, all I know is that it seems as though the `assess = ''` declaration seems to be called every single time the function that uses it is ran, I guess this is the result of the `__main__` loop iterating over everything on every input?

I want to share an update to a documentation tool I've been working on for the last month or so. It's a Sphinx extension that parses code examples to insert links to reference documentation for the functions and classes that the example uses. Let me just show the output:[example image](https://preview.redd.it/i1zsohfsjor71.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&s=83eed59477e3f1c4048390f84fa6b76abd80e0c7)Clicking the link would take you to numpy.linspace's documentation on their site. That's basically it! I think being able to jump from examples to reference is a huge boost in user experience, and using this extension is essentially just flicking a switch, because the examples don't need any special additions. But I have included some shiny features on the side:* Backreference table: link back to all code examples that use a specific definition* Autodoc integration: automatically insert the backref table to all documented objects* Intersphinx integration: as you see in the image, it works out of the box with external packagesA live demo is available on [RTD](https://sphinx-codeautolink.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and I just released the third beta version on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-codeautolink/). If you'd like to check development status, we're on [GitHub](https://github.com/felix-hilden/sphinx-codeautolink). In this release I added support for Python console examples (>>> prefixed code) and star imports, fixed a bunch of issues, and changed the directive names for the better. I'm super excited about this because I really believe this only makes documentation better and could be used in all sorts of places. What do you reckon?Thanks for reading and have a great day!",POS

I just released this project I've been working on. There is already a lot of loggers for Python but not like this one.Here is the repo: [https://github.com/PabloLec/livelog](https://github.com/PabloLec/livelog)# What is it?Basically **it's a file logger and a live reader**.  It is aimed to be used when you cannot log directly to the console.   For example when you're working on a GUI, TUI, a software plugin or just  anything spawned by another shell.**It is really easy to implement and use.**# How to use it ?In your code just import the Logger object:`from livelog import Logger`Instantiate it:`logger = Logger()`And use it, e.g:[`logger.info`](https://logger.info/)`(f""User selected element: {element}"")`or`logger.error(f""User selection raised the following error:\n{e}"")`Then, in your terminal type: `python3 -m livelog`The reader is now launched, any log will be displayed in real time. You didn't have to specify any argument.# Cool features* You can define a log level for the logger and another one for the reader.  This means you can just log anything to your file, leaving the default  DEBUG level, and use `python3 -m livelog -l warning`   to read. You'll only see live warnings and errors but debug and info levels will still be logged to your file.* The tool is compatible with all major OS: Windows, Linux and macOS. The  behavior will be exactly the same on all platforms. (which is not the  case with shell commands)* There is a built in singleton. Rather than the Logger object, import the  LoggerSingleton object. Just define your first instance with arguments  (file path, log level, etc.) somewhere in your package and then you will  be able to spawn other LoggerSingleton objects which will return your  first and unique instance. This avoids the hassle to pass the logger  object along your modules or using a global var.# Why not use native logging library?Native logging library does provide file logging. The main advantage here is  the simplicity, just smack that \`Logger\` object into your code and  you're good to go, **not even one argument needed**. Of course you can still provide a custom file, log level, disable/enable, etc.Why not use tail for reading?As said earlier, livelog works on all OS and has more handy features  (particularly log level filtering) than a bare tail command.\- - - - - -The motto is **simplicity and efficiency**. Give it a try if your project might need this kind of logger.Any comment, issue, feature request or PR would be appreciated !",POS

I was not really happy with Windows Scheduler nor Cron. Airflow seemed interesting but it felt rather complicated. So I thought I'll make my own scheduler. How hard could it be? Well, it was pretty hard and it took some time but I finally managed to create it. I introduce you to Red Engine.So Red Engine is a scheduling framework with a focus on readability, extendability and productivity. It has all sorts of bells and whistles but probably the most interesting features are the condition parser, parameterization strategies and meta tasking (a task can access to the whole framework).Basically you need initially set up the scheduling session (which is simply a Python object). But don't worry, there are several preconfigurations that you can just use and tinker what you need.But here is how setting a task can look like:    from redengine.tasks import FuncTask        @FuncTask(start_cond=""daily between 05:00 and 10:00 & after task 'another task'"")    def my_task():        ... # Do whatever.    This task (will be named as ""my\_task"") will run once a day between 5 AM and 10 AM and also a task called ""another task"" must have succeeded before. There are tons of options to create scheduling strategies but here are some [more examples](https://red-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/conditions/time.html). You can also parallelize the tasks to run on separate thread or process. And this is also not the only way to set up a task. It is pretty extendable.Install it:    pip install redengineAnd then just create a project from a template and see yourself:    python -m redengine create myproject --template simpleor start the premade schduler:    python myproject/main.pyHere is also a standalone example (all in one file) if it was not clear how could look as a whole: [https://red-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/session/standalone.html](https://red-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/session/standalone.html)It also does work: there are over 900 unit tests, tested with Python 3.6 and 3.8 (Windows and Unix/Linux) and from now on I try to keep the API stable. And I tried to make the docs as thorough as possible constrained by my free time. I also see if I can put this to conda. The only dependencies are Pandas and Pyyaml and it is pure Python.&#x200B;I wonder what you think. Do you think this would be useful? Also, all suggestions, ideas and bug reports are welcome.Link to the source: [https://github.com/Miksus/red-engine](https://github.com/Miksus/red-engine)",POS

Mostly we used Outlining software which we then copy/pasted into the IDE as a starting point for coding.This way, you always knew what that block of code was supposed to be doing and weren't tempted into producing spaghetti as the scope of each chunk was clearly described.I still do the same these days, but I wonder if that's how today's professionals do it?",NEU

Watching courses just for the sake of learning has not been beneficial for me.

You can also enter a location manually, and you can switch back and forth between imperial and metric.  Sorry, I'm American, so it defaults to imperial.  One day I'll change it so the default can be configured in the .env file.  Anyway, I know this isn't a major thing, but I'm proud of it, and I wanted to share and get some feedback.

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later.

I will have ownership of our code (~20k LOC python, mssql, kafka) and that means I will also have the chance to improve the one or other thing. The current state is not good but could be worse. You feel that various externals and other people had been involved through varying coding styles here and there and I would like to see how to unify this at least a bit. The by far largest part was done from a big fan of ‚Äòsimple data types, functions only, lots of seven layer deep ‚Äòcache = func(cache, x, y, ‚Ä¶)‚Äô like structures that make it really hard to reason about the current state during execution and not so many tests but there are some of course. What hurts the most is that most modules are about 700-1700 LOC, so a lot has just been attached over time. So all in all not a bad place to start. I think my boss likes me and hopes that can do good for the team, so I have some trust capital to work with. I previously worked on smaller problems - I know a lot of details about python and how to do unholy things, I‚Äôm lacking a bit the classical development schooling (I‚Äôm a mathematician and only started learning about proper patterns after I started working) but normally find some way to realise something in a somewhat good style.

This is best explained in an example: Imagine you have a family reunion where there is a big family photo. After the photo, many people want the photo for their personal memories and so they all get copies of the photo. They all want to save it to the cloud so they can have it for later. In storage server that saves all the photos, a deduper is running and notices the same photo has been saved by multiple people. The server will notice that it only needs to store one copy and just allow access to all the people that saved it to the cloud. But it doesn't have to be done with files, it can be done with chunks of files called blocks.I recently learned about this wanted to design my own, so I did! Here it is. I use this with my files and save a little bit of space here and there.[https://github.com/ThatOneShortGuy/Deduper](https://github.com/ThatOneShortGuy/Deduper)I would appreciate it if some of you guys helped me figure out how to make this faster. I've tried many different techniques and this one is the best I've got.# WARNINGI cannot guarantee that your files will remain intact and useable.

I want to share an update to a documentation tool I've been working on for the last month or so. It's a Sphinx extension that analyses code examples and inserts links to reference documentation for the functions and classes that the example uses. Better to just show the output:[example links](https://preview.redd.it/rdrbpxpxrtq71.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9b7e51de232097bbb8d4eda8265dd5a4daed76d)Clicking the link would take you to numpy.linspace's documentation on their site. That's basically it! I think being able to jump from examples to reference is a huge boost in user experience, and using this extension is essentially flicking a switch. The examples don't need any special additions. But I have included some shiny features on the side:* Backreference table: link back to all code examples that use a specific definition* Autodoc integration: automatically insert the backref table to all documented objects* Intersphinx integration: as you see in the image, it works out of the box with external packages A live demo is available on [RTD](https://sphinx-codeautolink.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and I just released the second beta version on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-codeautolink/). If you'd like to check development status, we're on [GitHub](https://github.com/felix-hilden/sphinx-codeautolink). In this release I fixed a bunch of issues and included a simple type hint resolver, so you can chain calls like `lib.func().attr.another().thing` If the functions are type hinted unambiguously, three links will be inserted to cover `lib.func`, `attr.another` and `thing`.I'm super excited about this, because I really believe this only makes documentation better and could be used in all sorts of places. What do you reckon? I was inspired by the awesome docs of Matplotlib and Sklearn, which use Sphinx-Gallery. It does a similar thing but for python files that are then turned into rST. Their source was also very helpful when stumbling around Sphinx and docutils internals üòÇLet me know what you think and thanks for reading! Have a great weekend!",POS

So it relies on having a sorted   list so you have this list. Let's say it's 1024 items long. And what you do   with binary search is you go to the middle item of this sorted list and if   that's the item you're looking for then that's it.The search is over.   if the item is not the item you're looking for but is higher than it in numerical value or in the latter value   depending what it is that you're searching for. Then you can say well the item   that I'm looking for must be in the left part of the list because I know these   are in the correct order they're sorted. &#x200B;https://i.redd.it/bxaja3qe8gq71.gifSo if I've landed on the midpoint of this list and I'm the item I land on is   higher in value than the item I'm looking for.I can get rid of all of the   items to the right of me to the to the right of the item that I've landed on   because I know that they are also going to be too high. And then you repeat   that process.continue reading on [Python Binary search explained with examples](https://blog.icodes.tech/posts/Python-Binary-search.html),POS

A tutorial series where Pythonistas could learn how to use this programming language to e.g., compute the position of planets and asteroids, to create animations of 3D surface data of comets or to derive some scientific insights.The medium I have chosen back then was [Medium.com](https://Medium.com). I published my articles at TowardsDataScience and got some positive feedback. However, I was not 100 % happy with the format though the GitHub repository was frequently visited. Anyway... some private things happened, the lockdown faded away slowly and I focused on some other astronomy and space topics. However, I still had the plan to continue or refresh / reset my tutorial series in a more accessible setup.Now I started to create the ""Space Science with Python"" tutorial series on YouTube. Please don't yell at me: Since I just started, the video quality, the setup etc. does not appear sophisticated (so no fancy animations, logo etc.). I just want to start showing everyone what one can achieve with Python in Astronomy and Space Science.So what will we learn?* First, we will cover the basics: creating a working setup, basic physics and computation of positions using state-of-the-art libraries that are used since years* We will create animations, plots and figures that help us understanding scientific insights. What does it mean? We'll see!* We will use raw scientific data that are available for free to do science. We will use telescope data, lab-data as well as data from spacecraft probes. Since I worked on the Rosetta/Philae and Cassini/Huygens mission, I have a lot to show and tell.* We will also use Machine Learning methods (Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models, ...) to identify yet unknown and hidden structures in our asteroid and meteor datasets.* And much more!I hope you guys will like it. Or give me constructive feedback. The first video is a ""Welcome""-one and I need to relax a little bit more and improve. But maybe you guys will help me!There are a lot of ML tutorials out there.

Let me explain, you won't regret it.One of the unique thing about functional programming languages like Haskell is [lazy evaluation](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lazy_evaluation): ""expressions are not evaluated when they are bound to variables, but their evaluation is deferred until their results are needed by other computations. In consequence, arguments are not evaluated before they are passed to a function, but only when their values are actually used.""Most people know Python as a language with eager evaluation semantic and you probably already know that Python 3 changes most built in iterators like `map` and `filter` to become lazy, but that's not what lazy, non-strict evaluation is about in functional programming context, and also not what we're talking about here.Did you know that Python 3.7 implemented a lazy, non-strict evaluation syntax behind a `__future__` switch that is about to become enabled by default in ~~3.10~~ 3.11? If you missed this major syntax change, then yeah, you are not alone, most people still haven't known about lazy evaluation yet despite Python 3.7 being released nearly 4 years ago. Actually, this syntax change was so unknown that I don't think most CPython core developers even knew about them either.Let's see some example of lazy evaluation in Python 3.7 (for a full executable example, see the [full gist](https://gist.github.com/lieryan/506fe2c71598eb209348875fa3d87711), or [execute online](https://www.mycompiler.io/view/8N6IUcY)).    [snipped some setup code to enable lazy evaluation, see the full gist linked above for detail]    # the metaclass and the __annotations__ is necessary    # to declare a lazy evaluation context    class SimpleExample(metaclass=module_context):        __annotations__ = once_dict        # Lazy assignment in Python uses the `:` colon operator,        # not the eager `=` operator.         myVar : 5 + forty        # note: PEP8 hasn't been updated yet, but like regular assignments        # you should put spaces around lazy assignment operator        # and also to make it easy to distinguish lazy assignments with type hints        # which has similar syntax        # Notice that just like Haskell, lazy assignments in Python        # don't have to be written in execution order.        # You can write the assignments in whatever order you        # want and they'll still evaluate correctly.        # Useful for literate programming as well.        ten : 10        forty : ten + thirty        thirty : 30        # Names can only be defined once per lazy        # evaluation scope        # Commenting out the assignment to `forty` in the        # next line produces a compile-time exception:        # forty : ten + 2    # raises Exception: redefinition of forty, original value was ""ten + thirty"", new value ""ten + 2""        # dependant variables don't even need to exist,        # as long as we never need to evaluate        # `will_raise_name_error`, it won't cause problems        will_raise_name_error : does_not_exist + 10----Creating lazy functions are also possible in lazy python.Don't be fooled that we used the `class` keyword here, this is actually defining a function with lazy evaluation semantic, not a class!We can call it using normal Python syntax, e.g. `take(10, fibs)`    class LazyFunctions(metaclass=module_context):        __annotations__ = once_dict        # `take` is a lazy function to grab the first `n` items from a cons-list        class take:            # `params` declares the arguments list that a function takes, here we            # take two parameters an integer `n` specifying            # the number of items to take and `cons`            # specifying the list to operate on            params : (n, cons)            # lazy functions returns a value to the caller by assigning to `rtn`            rtn : (                nil if n == 0 else                nil if cons == nil else                nextItem            )            nextItem : (head(cons), rest)            # note that `take` is implemented recursively here, we're calling            # into `take` while defining `take`            rest : take(n-1, tail(cons))        # The equivalent eager Python code for `take`        # would look like this:        #        #     def take(n: int, cons: list):        #         if n == 0:        #             return ()        #         elif cons == ()        #             return ()        #         else:        #             rest = take(n-1, tail(cons))        #             nextItem = (head(cons), rest)        #             return nextItem        #Lazy Python does not support for or while loops, but who wants to use loops anyway when you have recursions like any proper functional programming languages do.----The next example here is defining an infinite Fibonacci list as a recursive literal list. A recursive literal definition is something that's only possible in language with lazy and non-strict evaluation semantic as the list values need to be computed only when you needed them. This is impossible to do in regular, eagerly-evaluated Python, which has to resort to less elegant constructs like generators to make infinite iterables.    class Fibonacci(metaclass=module_context):        __annotations__ = once_dict        # Based on Haskell code: (source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50101409/fibonacci-infinite-list-in-haskell)        #        #     fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)        #        fibs : (0, (1, zipWith(bundleArgs(int.__add__), fibs, tail(fibs))))        # see full gist for definitions of zipWith and bundleArgsLazy evaluated Python even supports type hinting. If you want to add type hinting to your lazy python code, you can do so using the `=` syntax. For example:    class TypeHinting(metaclass=module_context):        __annotations__ = once_dict        # Lists in lazy evaluation context are defined as        # cons-list, similar to Lisp. In eager Python code,        # this would be equivalent to the list        # `myVar = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.        # If you know linked list, cons-list is almost like one.        myList : (1, (2, (3, (4, nil)))) =List[int]        class double:            params : (n)            rtn : (                None if n == 0 else n*2            ) =Optional[str]        # note: again PEP8 still needs to be updated about the rules        # of spacing around the type hinting syntax, put a space        # before the `=` operator but not after itUses of type hints in Lazy Python are currently somewhat limited though, since I don't think there's any type hint linters that currently supports checking annotations of lazy python yet.----The familiar `if __name__ == '__main__'` construct works slightly differently in lazy Python:    class MainFunction(metaclass=module_context):        __annotations__ = once_dict        # `main` is a special construct to execute instructions        # in order of execution. It's automatically called        # and returns the last value in the ""tuple""/function body.        # Here we print some values and return `myVar`.        # Unlike most things in lazy evaluation context, order        # is important in a `main` construct, so it's useful        # when you need to call something for their side effect.        # It has similar purpose as IO in Haskell.        main : (            print('simple'),            print(myVar),            print(take(10, fibs)),            # last value will automatically be            # returned when MainFunction() is called            myVar,        )    returned_var = MainFunction()    # use thunk.ensure_value() to force eager evaluation    assert isinstance(myVar, thunk)    assert returned_var == thunk.ensure_value(myVar)    # actually doing a simple `assert returned_var == myVar` would     # also just work in this case, as we're outside lazy evaluation context,     # as thunks **usually** would get evaluated automatically when used    # in non-lazy context----How do I start writing lazy Python? Well, in most languages, like Haskell, lazy evaluation is called lazy evaluation, but for some reason Python called the lazy evaluation mode feature ""annotations"". So if you're using Python < ~~3.10~~ 3.11, which is probably most of you, this feature is not yet enabled by default, so you're going to need to import the `__future__` feature first:    #!/usr/bin/env python3    from __future__ import annotationsAlso, you'll need to import the `lazyutils.py` module from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/lieryan/506fe2c71598eb209348875fa3d87711#file-lazyutils-py)    from lazyutils import *Then at the top of your lazy python code, you'll need to create a lazy execution context:    once_dict = single_assignment_dict()        # create an evaluation namespace, in this case, we create a namespace    # that will modify this module's global variables directly    module_context = create_lazy_evaluation_context(globals(), locals())        # you can also create a private context that won't modify your module global variables by doing so:    # scope = {    #    ... provide some initial values for the execution scope ...    # }    # private_context = create_lazy_evaluation_context(scope, scope)Finally just write some lazy python:    class MyLazyPythonCode(metaclass=module_context):        __annotations__ = once_dict        ... this is where you put lazy python code ...---- Why lazy Python? By having non-strict evaluation, Python can finally join the godhood of functional languages. You can now reorder statements freely, [do literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), referential transparency mumbo jumbo, and finally be ordained into the monkhood of academic language that everybody talked about but nobody uses, just like Haskell.
